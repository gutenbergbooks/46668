<div class="sidenote">1272.</div>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 1.</div>

<p>Edward, the first of that name after the conquest, began his reigne ouer this
kingdome of England, the 16 day of Nouember, in the yeare of the world, 5239,
of our Lord 1272, of the Saxons 814, after the conquest 206, the vacation of the empire
after the deceasse of Frederike the second as yet induring (though shortlie after in
the yeare next following, Radulfe of Habspurge was elected emperour) in the third yeare
of Philip the third then reigning in France, and Alexander the third yet liuing in gouernement
of the Scottish kingdome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1273.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Guy de M&#x014D;tfort excommunicated.</div>

<p>This Edward the first, when his father died, being about the age of 35 yeares, was as
then in the holie land, or rather in his iournie homewards: but wheresoeuer he was at
that present, the nobles of the land, after his father was departed this life, assembled at
the new temple in London, and causing a new seale to be made, they ordeined faithfull
ministers and officers, which should haue the treasure in k&eacute;eping, and the administration
of iustice for the maintenance of peace and tranquillitie within the land, and on the 22
day of Nouember he was proclaimed king. Who after he had remained a time in the
holie land, and perceiued himselfe destitute of such aid as he looked for at the hands
both of the Christians and Tartarians, he left in the citie of Acon certeine stipendarie
soldiers, and taking the sea sailed homewards, arriuing first in Sicill, where, of Charles
K. of that land he was honorablie receiued and conueied, till he came vnto Ciuita
Vecchia in Italie, where pope Gregorie as then laie with his court, of whome (as of his
old fr&eacute;end that had b&eacute;en with him in the holie land) he obteined that earle Aldebrandino
Rosso, and Guy of Montfort, that had murthered the lord Henrie, eldest sonne to Richard
king of Almaine, might be sent for. Earle Aldebrandino purged himselfe, but Guy
de Montfort was exc&#x014D;municated, as a violator of the church, a murderer and a traitor, so
as he was disherited euen vnto the fourth generation, till he had reconciled himselfe to the
church, as he was inioined.</p>

<p>After this, it is woonderfull to remember with what great honor king Edward was receiued
of the cities, as he passed through Tuscaine and Lumbardie. At his comming
ouer the mounteins at Chalon in Burgundie, he was at a iusts and tornie, which then was
there holden by the Frenchmen against the Englishmen, the honor whereof remained with the
Englishmen. In this tornie the fight of the footmen was great: for the Englishmen being
sore prouoked, slue manie of the French footmen, but bicause they were but rascals, no
great accompt was made of them, for they were vnarmed, gaping for the spoile of them
that were ouerthrowen. K. Edward passing foorth came to the French court, where of
his coosine germane king Philip he was ioifullie receiued. Here king Edward, dooing
homage to the French king for the lands which he ought to hold of him in France, passed
into Guien.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. West.</i></div>

<p>A tenth was granted of the cleargie to the K. and to his brother Edmund earle of Leicester
and Lancaster by the popes appointment for two yeares, a chapleine of the pope a
Gascoine borne named Reimond being sent into England for that purpose, who gaue part
vnto them, and part thereof he kept to himselfe towards his charges, but the most part
was reserued to the popes disposing. &para; Whilest the king remained in Gascoigne, he had
somwhat to do against certeine rebels, as Gaston de Bierne, and other that were reuolted
from him. The castels belonging to the said Gaston he subdued, but his person he could
not m&eacute;et with. Finallie, after he had set things in order as well in Guien as in other
places in the parts of beyond the seas, he hasted homewards, and came to London on the
second day of August, where he was receiued with all ioy that might be deuised. The
str&eacute;ets were hanged with rich cloths of silke, arras, and tapestrie, the aldermen and burgesses
of the citie threw out of their windowes handfuls of gold and siluer, to signifie the
great gladnesse which they had conceiued of his safe returne: the conduits ran plentifullie
with white wine and red, that ech creature might drinke his fill. Vpon the 19 day
of August, in this second yeare of his reigne he was crowned at Westminster, togither
with his wife qu&eacute;ene Elianor, by the hands of Robert Kilwarbie archbishop of Canturburie.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Caxton.</i></div>

<p>At this coronation were present Alexander king of Scots, and Iohn earle of Britaine,
with their wiues that were sisters to K. Edward. The king of Scots did homage vnto
king Edward for the realme of Scotland, in like maner as other the kings of Scotland before
him had doone to other kings of England ancestours to this king Edward. At the
solemnitie of this coronation there were let go at libertie (catch them that catch might)
fiue hundred great horsses by the king of Scots, the earles of Cornewall, Glocester,
Penbroke, Warren, &amp; others, as they were allighted fr&#x014D; their backs. &para; On S. Nicholas
euen there chanced such an earthquake with lightning and thunder, and therewithall the
appearing of the burning drake, and a blasing starre called a comet, that the people
were brought into no small feare vpon consideration thereof. But now to the point of
the historie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1275.</div>

<div class="sidenote">An. Reg. 3.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A parlement. The statutes of Westminster. The prince of Wales Leolin.</div>

<p>King Edward at the first like a prudent prince chose the wisest and worthiest men to
be of his councell, &amp; to purchase the loue of his subiects, whose minds were somewhat
offended towards his father (by reason that he refused to k&eacute;epe promise with them,
touching the restitution of gentle and fauourable lawes) king Edward shewed himselfe
so gentle towards all degr&eacute;es of men, that he s&eacute;emed to exc&eacute;ed the reasonable bounds of
courteous humanitie, much more than became his roiall estate. After this he reformed
diuerse lawes and statutes, and deuised some new ordinances, greatlie for the wealth of
the realme. He held his first parlement at Westminster, where the ordinances were
made, called the statutes of Westminster the first.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king c&#x014D;meth to Chester.</div>

<p>To this parlement was Leolin the prince of Wales summoned to come and doo his homage,
hauing b&eacute;ene requested first to come to the kings coronation, but he refused; and
now hauing summons to come to this parlement, he excused himselfe, affirming that he
durst not come for feare of certeine noblemen that laie in wait for his life, requiring to
haue pledges deliuered for his safe comming and going, the kings sonne, and Gilbert earle
of Glocester, with Robert Burnell the lord chancelor. The king was greatlie offended
with such a presumptuous demand, but passed it ouer, till after the end of the parlement,
&amp; then repairing to Chester he sent eftsoones messengers to the said Leolin, requiring of
him to come &amp; doo his homage, but he still detracted time, so that in the end the king
raised an armie, meaning to recouer that by force, which otherwise he could not obteine
by quiet meanes. &para; This y&eacute;ere the people paid a fift&eacute;enth to the king of all their temporall
goods, which was said to be granted first to his father.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. West.</i></div>

<p>The same y&eacute;ere departed this life Iohn Breton bishop of Hereford, who being verie
expert in the lawes of the land, compiled a booke of them called Le Breton. The 11 of
September, a generall earthquake chanced betwixt the first houre and the third of the
same daie, the church of S. Michaell on the hill without Glastenburie, was therwith
throwne down to the ground. After this, it rained bloud in the countrie of Wales, as a
prodigious euill token to that nation, with whose bloud shortlie after that region was
in manie places moistened and stained. For as it chanced shortlie after, Leolin the
sonne of Griffin came to haue the gouernment of Wales, who partlie to raise new seditions
in England, and partlie to purchase him friendship and aliance in France, sent vnto
king Philip, requiring of him that he might haue in marriage the ladie Elianor daughter
to Simon Montfort earle of Leicester, the which togither with hir mother and brother
Emerike, remained as banished persons in France. The French king granted his request,
and sent hir vnder the conduct of hir said brother to be conueied into Wales vnto Leolin,
who had promised to marrie hir. But yer they approched to Wales, at the Ile of Sillie
both the brother &amp; sister were taken by foure ships of Bristow, the owners whereof that
so tooke them, sent them vnto king Edward. When Leolin vnderstood that his wife was
taken from him by the waie as she was comming, he was not a little wroth, and incontinentlie
began to make warre vpon king Edwards subiects that bordered n&eacute;ere vnto Wales,
killing the people, spoiling their goods, and burning vp their townes and houses on
each side.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. Westm.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The excheker and the kings bench remoued to Shrewesburie.</div>

<p>Herewith the king of England was so mooued, that although the said Leolin made sute
for peace, and offered no small sum of monie to haue the daughter of the earle of
Leicester his fianced wife deliuered to him, yet would not the king by any meanes consent
to that marriage, nor receiue any monie of him, except he would restore vnto the right
owners such lands as he had inuaded and got into his possession, and further repaire
such castels as he had destroied. Herevpon grew no small grudge betwixt the Welshmen
and Englishmen, so that to represse the inuasion of the enimies in the parts towards
Bristow, Mountgomerie and Chester, the king sent thr&eacute;e hundred men in armes on
horssebacke. In the quindene of Easter, the king departing from Westminster, hasted
towards Wales with a mightie power, and caused the courts of the excheker and of his
bench to remooue vnto Shrewesburie, that they might be n&eacute;ere vnto him, making forward
with all conuenient sp&eacute;ed to come to the aid and succour of his liege people.</p>

<p>Hervpon entring into Wales he tooke the castell of Rutland, and sent into Westwales
a valiant capteine named Paine de Camureijs, who with fire and sword wasted that countrie,
so that the people offering themselues to the kings peace, deliuered vnto the said
Paine the castell of Stridewie with the countrie adioining. Then Leolin the prince of
Wales, perceiuing that he was not able to resist the kings power, and knowing that if he
did attempt the conflict against him the danger would redound to himself &amp; his traine,
did as th' old verse counselleth,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>N. Triuet.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">C&#x014D;missioners appointed.</div>

<p>and therefore made suit for peace, in so much that finallie it was agr&eacute;ed, that commissioners
for both parts should talke concerning certeine articles, and whatsoeuer they concluded,
aswell the king as the said Leolin should hold the same for firme and stable.
The king appointed one of his commissioners, to wit, the lord Robert de Tiptost, to take
an oth for him, &amp; authorised the said Robert Anthonie Beke, and frier William de
Southampton, prior prouinciall of the friers preachers, commissioners, nominated on his
behalfe, to receiue the like oth of the said Leolin. Which Leolin appointed commissioners
for his part, Tuder ap Edeuenet, and Grono ap Helin, the which commissioners with
good deliberation concluded vpon certeine points and articles, of which the principall
were as followeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1</div>

<p>First, that the said Leolin should set at libertie all prisoners which he held in captiuitie
for the king of Englands cause, fr&eacute;elie and without all challenge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2</div>

<p>Secondlie, that to haue peace and the kings of Englands fauour, he should giue vnto
the said king fiftie thousand pounds sterling, the daies of the paiement whereof to rest in
the kings will and pleasure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3</div>

<p>Thirdlie, that the land of the foure cantreds without all contradiction should remaine
for euer to the king and his heires, with all lands conquered by the king and his people,
the Ile of Anglesey excepted, which Ile was granted to the prince, so that he should paie
for the same yearelie the summe of one thousand marks, and fiue thousand marks for an
income. Prouided, that if the prince chanced to die without issue, then the said Ile to
reuert againe into the kings hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">4</div>

<p>Fourthlie, that the prince shall come to Rothelan or Rothland (as it is commonlie called)
there to doo fealtie to the king, and before his comming thither, he should be absolued
and haue the interdiction of his lands released, and at his being at Rothelan, a daie shall
be appointed him by the king for his comming to London, there to doo his homage.
Herevpon was order taken for his safe conduct, aswell in his comming to Rothelan, as to
London. There be that write that he was appointed to come vnto London, at the feast
of the natiuitie of our Lord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">5</div>

<p>Fifthlie, it was couenanted, that all the homages of Wales should remaine to the king,
except onelie of fiue barons which inhabited n&eacute;ere vnto the castell of Snowdon: for
otherwise the said Leolin could not conuenientlie call himselfe prince, except he had some
barons vnder him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6</div>

<p>Sixtlie, that he should receiue the title and name of prince so long as he liued, and
after his deceasse the homages of those fiue barons should reuert to the king and to his
heires for euer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>N. Triuet.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">Dauid Leolins brother prouided for.</div>

<p>Seuenthlie the king granted vnto the said Leolin, the lands that belonged to his brother
Dauid, for tearme of the said Leolins life, and in recompense thereof was contented to
satifie the said Dauid with other lands in some other place, the which after the decease of
the said Leolin or Dauid should reuert to the king and his heires.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An oth to be receiued.</div>

<p>For the assurance of which articles and couenants the prince deliuered for hostages ten
persons of the best in Wales, which he could get, without imprisonment, disheriting, or
terme of deliuerance: and of euerie cantred twentie persons, of the best and most sufficient,
to be chosen by such as the king shall send thither y&eacute;erelie, &amp; shall from y&eacute;ere to
y&eacute;ere be sworne vpon the euangelists, in presence of the bailiffes of the said Leolin, that
whensoeuer the prince shall breake any of these articles, and vpon admonition dooth not
reforme himselfe, they shall forsake him, and in all things, being vnto him open enimies,
shall beare him deadlie hostilitie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leolins brethren.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dauid rewarded by king Edward.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dauid preferred in marriage.</div>

<p>Besides this, the prince shall (as farre as in him may lie) pacifie his brethren, of the
which he had put two in prison, Owen and Roderike: the third named Dauid, escaping
his hands, fled into England, and remained many y&eacute;eres with king Edward, who receiuing
him into his seruice, made him knight in this warre, and gaue vnto him a castell at Denbigh
in Wales, with lands to the y&eacute;erelie value of a thousand marks, in recompense of
those possessions which he ought to haue had in Anglesey, the which (as before is said)
the king granted vnto Leolin for tearme of his life, and after his deceasse to reuert vnto
the king and to his heires. Moreouer, he preferred Dauid to the marriage of a iollie
widowe, that was daughter to the earle of Darbie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The article concerning Owen.</div>

<p>As concerning Owen, through the kings fauour he was deliuered out of prison, by force
of the articles concluded at this present by the commissioners, vnder this forme and maner:
that vpon his being set at libertie, certeine persons appointed by the king should make
offer to him, to choose whether he would first compound with his brother, and therevpon
come to the king, and bes&eacute;ech him to allow the composition, or else to put himselfe vnder
the safe k&eacute;eping of the king, till according to the lawes and customes of Wales, in the
place where he did transgresse, iudgement should be giuen of the matter: and if he were
acquit, then might he demand his heritage if he thought it so expedient: and which
of these two waies he should choose, the same should be made firme and stable in the
kings presence.</p>

<p>All these articles, with other additions, were accorded by the said c&#x014D;missioners at Aberconweie,
on the tuesdaie before the feast of S. Martine, in the yeare 1277, and letters of
confirmation made thereof by the king, dated at Rutland on the tenth daie of Nouember,
in the fift y&eacute;ere of his reigne. Also the said Leolin, by the name of Leolin ap Griffin prince
of Wales, with letters vnder his seale, confirmed the abouesaid articles on his behalfe,
for the releasing of his right to the foure cantreds and other things that should remaine
to the king, which letters bare date at Aberconweie, on the foresaid tuesdaie in the said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
y&eacute;ere 1277. Also the K. released to the said Leolin, the said summe of fiftie thousand
pounds, and the said summe of a thousand marks y&eacute;erelie to be paid for the Ile of Anglesey,
as by his letters dated at Rutland on the said 10 daie of Nouember in the said fift
y&eacute;ere of his reigne more at large it app&eacute;ereth. Neuerthelesse by his letters dated at Rutland,
on the said eleuenth of the said month of Nouember, it is euident that he receiued

archbishop of Canturburie held a synod at Reading about the latter end of Iulie, wherin
he renewed the constitutions of the generall councell, as thus: That no ecclesiasticall
person should haue aboue one benefice to the which belonged cure of soule; and againe,

<p>The lord Roger Mortimer kept a great feast at Killingworth, with iusts and triumphs
of an hundred knights and as manie ladies, to the which resorted lords, knights, &amp; gentlemen
from diuerse countries and lands, to shew proofe of their valiancie in the practise of
warlike feats and exercises. In the meane season king Edward standing in n&eacute;ed of monie,
deuised a new shift to serue his turne, as this: namely that whereas he was ch&eacute;efe
lord of many lordships, manours, possessions and tenements, he well vnderstood, that partlie
by length and proces of time, and partlie by casualties during the troubles of the
ciuill warres, manie mens euidences, as their charters, d&eacute;eds, copies and other writings
were lost, wasted, and made awaie, he therfore vnder colour to put the statute of (Quo
Warranto) in execution which was ordeined this yeare in the parlement holden at Glocester
in August last past (as some write) did now command by publike proclamation, that
all such as held any lands or tenements of him, should come and shew by what right
and title they held the same, that by such meanes their possessions might returne vnto
him, by escheat as ch&eacute;efe lord of the same, and so to be sold or red&eacute;emed againe at his

<p>This was thought to be so sore a proclamation, as that a more gr&eacute;euous had not lightlie
b&eacute;en heard of. Men in euerie place made complaint and shewed themselues gr&eacute;euouslie
offended, so that the king by meanes thereof came in great hatred of his people: but the
meane sort of men, though they stood in defense of their right, yet it auailed them but
little, bicause they had no euidence to shew, so that they were constreined to be quiet
with losse, rather than to striue against the streame. Manie were thus called to answer,
till at length the lord Iohn Warren earle of Surrie, a man greatlie beloued of the people,
perceiuing the king to haue cast his net for a preie, and that there was not one which
spake against him, determined to stand against those so bitter and cruell proc&eacute;edings.
And therefore being called afore the iustices about this matter, he appeared, and being
asked "by what right he held his lands?" suddenlie drawing foorth an old rustie sword;
"By this instrument (said he) doo I hold my lands, and by the same I intend to defend
them. Our ancestors comming into this realme with William the Conquerour, conquered
their lands with the sword, and with the same will I defend me from all those that
should be about to take them from me; he did not make a conquest of this realme alone,
our progenitors were with him as participants and helpers."</p>

<p>The king vnderstanding into what hatred of his people by this meanes he was fallen,
and therfore desirous to auoid ciuill dissention and war that might thereby insue, he left
off his begun practise: so that the thing which generallie should haue touched and b&eacute;ene
hurtfull to all men, was now suddenlie staied by the manhood and couragious stoutnesse
onelie of one man, the foresaid earle, who in his rare act of defending c&#x014D;mon equitie

and with menaces staied him from concluding any thing that might preiudice his roiall
liberties and prerogatiues. King Edward held a parlement at London, in the which he
demanded a fift&eacute;enth of the cleargie, which latelie before he had got of the temporaltie.
The archbishop of Yorke was content at the first to grant this fift&eacute;enth to be paid of the
cleargie within his diocesse in two yeares; but the archbishop of Canturburie held off,
and required respit till the next parlement to be holden after Easter, and then he granted

<p>In the ninth yeare of king Edwards reigne, the feast of the round table was kept at Warwike
with great and sumptuous triumph. Whilest these things were in dooing, Dauid
brother to Leolin prince of Wales, forgetting the great benefits which he had receiued at
the hands of king Edward, became his aduersarie, and caused his said brother the prince
of Wales with a great number of other noble men of that countrie to rebell: and to incourage
them the sooner to attempt the warre, he began the first exploit himselfe,
taking the said lord Roger Clifford (a right worthie and famous knight) in his castell
of Hawardine, vpon Palmesundaie, the said lord being in no doubt of any such matter.

King Edward at the same time being in the parts about Salisburie, where he kept his
Easter at the Vies, sent out commissioners to leauie an armie, and commanded such men
of warre as he had then in a readinesse, to hast foorth to the rescue of the castell of Rutland.
And in the meane time, the castell of Lamperdeuaux was taken by Rice ap Malgone
and Griffith ap Meridoc. Also diuerse other castels were taken by other of the Welsh
nobilitie. Moreouer, about this time by the labour and suit of Iohn the archbishop of
Canturburie, Emericke de Montfort, which had b&eacute;ene reteined in prison (sith that he
was first taken togither with his sister at the Ile of Sillie by the Bristowmen) was now
set at libertie and permitted to returne into France. The said archbishop of Canturburie
was sent into Wales to persuade Leolin and his brother with the other rebels vnto
peace and quietnesse, but returning into England, without bringing anie thing to passe, he
denounced them accurssed.</p>

<p>The king hasted foorth to come to the rescue of his people, wherevpon Leolin and his
brother Dauid retired with their people to Snowdon hilles, and fortified the castell there
with a strong garrison of men. The king entring into Wales, when he heard that his
enimies were withdrawne into the mounteins, passed foorth till he came n&eacute;ere vnto them,
where he pitched downe his field, and the next day causing his horssemen to issue foorth
of the campe, filled all the plaines which compasse the foot of those hilles (aswell on the
east side as toward the south) with the same horssemen, and herewith placed his footmen
more aloft on the side of the hilles in couert: this doone he prouoked his enimie to come
foorth to fight, but when he saw this would not be, then that he might stop them from all
places of refuge, he caused his ships to take the Isle of Anglesey, bicause the Welshmen
vsed to flie thither oftentimes for their safegard, in the which enterprise the mariners of
the cinque ports bare themselues right manfullie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meneth.</div>

<p>After this, ioining certeine vessels togither, he caused a bridge to be made in the riuer
of Meneth, into the which an other small riuer falleth that riseth at the roots of those hilles
of Snowdone, to k&eacute;epe the enimies from lodging on the further side of that riuer. This
bridge conteining roome for thr&eacute;escore armed men to passe afront, was made ouer the riuer
of Sient, by the which men saile into the Isle, which by the course of the sea ebbeth and
floweth euerie twelue houres. But so it came to passe, that before the bridge was well
boorded ouer, whilest the king yet remained at Aberconwaie, diuerse of the English

armour, manie of them were drowned: and amongst other, that famous knight sir Lucas

fought a sore battell with them, in the which manie of the Welshmen being slaine, the earle
lost also fiue knights vpon his partie, as William Valence the yoonger, being one of that

Leolin the prince of Wales entered into the countrie of Cardigan and Stradwie, destroieng
the lands of Rice ap Meridoc, which now held with the king against the said prince. At

maine armie behind him aloft vpon the top of the mounteine, n&eacute;ere to the water called
Waie, and he had set a number of his people to k&eacute;epe the bridge of Orewin: and so the

but yet the Englishmen by the conduct of the same Helias, got ouer by the same foord, so
that it bare the name long after of Helias way. And so the Welshmen that kept the
bridge (perceiuing the Englishmen to be got ouer vnto that side) fled, wherevpon the
residue of the English armie passed ouer at the bridge, whereof rose a great noise which
Leolin lurking not farre off might well heare, but yet at the first he could not be brought
to thinke that by any possible means the Englishmen were got ouer to that side of the
water. But yet perceiuing it to be true, he drue backe toward the heigth of the mounteine
againe, neuerthelesse being discouered by one Stephan de Franketon, named by some
writers Sward, he was so narrowlie pursued of the same Stephan, that he was ouertaken
and slaine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leolins head presented to the king.</div>

<p>Stephan not knowing whome he had slaine, returned to the host, the which was now
mounting vp the hill to ioine with the Welsh armie that stood still looking for the returne

plentie of arowes and darts at the Englishmen as they came vp towards them.
The English archers which were mingled amongst the horssemen, paid them home againe
with their shot, so that finallie the English horssemen, winning the top of the hill, slue
manie of them standing stoutlie at defense, and put the residue to flight. Stephan Sward
that had slaine Leolin, after the victorie was atchieued, rode to the dead bodie which he
had slaine in the beginning of the battell, and vpon vew taken of him perceiued who he
was, of which good hap the Englishmen were verie ioifull. His head was herewith cut
off, which the lord Edmund Mortimer tooke with him vnto Rutland (where the king as
then was lodged) vnto whome he presented it: and the king sent it vnto London, appointing
that there should be an yuie crowne set vpon it, in token that he was a prince, and so
being adorned, a horsseman carried it vpon the end of his staffe through Cheapside,
holding it as he rode on heigth, that all men might s&eacute;e it, till he came to the tower,

she answered, that he should boldlie go forward in them, for he should ride with a crowne
on his head through Cheapside: and so by the deceiuable prophesie he was deluded &amp;
brought to destruction. The incounter wherein the Welshmen were vanquished (as before
ye haue heard) chanced on the fridaie before S. Lucies day. King Edward being certified
thus of the victorie, streightwaies marched foorth with his people, and appointed at euerie
passage certeine bands of souldiers to lie in wait for the enimies. Also at the foot of the
hilles he left his horssemen, and mounted vp the hilles himselfe, with the residue of his
armie. There were certeine Gascoignes, whome the lord Iohn Vescie had brought with
him out of their countrie, to serue the king, which burned manie townes, and slue great
numbers of the Welshmen, all that came in their waie, and finallie, giuing an assault to
Snowdon castell, they wan it in fine by force.</p>

<p>In this meane time, the Welshmen, when they saw themselues inclosed, and stopped
from all waies to escape, after the maner of wild beasts, fled into the thicke woods &amp;
caues, some of them making shift to get downe through the st&eacute;epe and broken rocks, and
some of them s&eacute;eking to escape by flight, fell into their enimies hands, &amp; were either slaine

builded a strong castell, where before was an house of white moonks, the which he remooued
to the Vale roiall in Chesshire, where he builded a faire abbeie of the Cisteaux
order, and endowed it with great lands and reuenues. He also made and fortified the
castell of Carnaruan fast by Snowdon, and repared againe the towne of Lambaterwhir,
otherwise called Abreswich, which Leolin had before beaten downe. Also he placed
English garrisons in the castels and holds by the sea sides, and made Englishmen lords of

anie English king can be remembred, to haue kept any solemne feast at Bristow. The
king then leauing his court of chancerie at Bristow, with his children, came to London,
where he had not b&eacute;ene almost of thr&eacute;e yeares before. H&eacute;ere came messengers to him
from the French king, requiring him to come in person, with a certeine number of men of
warre, to aid him in the warres against the king of Aragon, as of right he ought to doo,
by reason of the dutchie of Guien which he held of him. The same yeare died William the

<div class="sidenote">The death of the Scotish king.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rich. South.</i></div>

<p>The ninet&eacute;enth of March, died Alexander king of Scotland, by a fall which he caught
as he ran a stirring horsse: he left no issue behind him, nor any certeine knowne heire
to succ&eacute;ed him, by reason wherof insued great harme to that relme (as in the Scotish
historie may more at large appeare.) The manner of whose death (as in Richard Southwell
I find it reported) I haue thought good br&eacute;eflie to touch, for that in recitall thereof,
he somewhat disagr&eacute;eth from the Scotish historie. There went (saith he) a common
speach through Scotland all this yeare, before the kings death, that on the same ninet&eacute;enth
of March the daie of iudgement should be: wherevpon, as the said king sat at
dinner in the castell of Edenburgh, hauing a dish of excellent good lampries before him,
he sent part thereof to one of the lords that sat at some other table not far from him,
and willed him by the gentleman that bare it, to be merrie, and haue in mind that this
was the day of doome. The lord sent him thanks againe, and praied the messenger to
tell the king merilie, that if this were the daie of doome, they should rise to iudgement
sp&eacute;edilie with their bellies filled with good meats and drinks. After they had dined, and
the night began to draw on, he tooke his horsse, and onlie accompanied with thr&eacute;e gentlemen,
would n&eacute;eds ride to Kingorne, where the qu&eacute;ene his new wife then laie, and before
he could get vnto Innerkenin, it was darke night, so that he tooke there two guides to
lead him the waie: but they had not ridden past two miles, but that the guides had quite
lost the waie, so that they were driuen to giue their horsses libertie to beat it out themselues.</p>

<p>Herewithall the king being seuered from his companie, how he ruled his horsse it is
hard to saie, but downe he was throwne, and immediatlie died with the vehement fall
which he thus caught, either headlong downe one of the cliffes or otherwise, and thus he
came to his end, on a mondaie, being saint Cuthberts euen the ninet&eacute;enth of March (as
before is noted) after he had reigned six &amp; thirtie yeares and nine moneths, as the same
Southwell saieth; who also (contrarie to that which Hector Boetius writeth) affirmeth,
that the same daie was so tempestuous with wind, snow, haile and raine, that he and manie
other that then liued and felt it, durst not vncouer their faces, in going abroad against the
bitter northerne wind, that droue the snow and sl&eacute;et most vehementlie vpon them. And
although that such fowle weather might haue staied him from taking his iournie in that
sort, yet he made no accompt thereof, as he that was accustomed to ride as well in fowle
weather as faire, and spared neither for tempest, waters, nor craggie rocks, thicke nor
thin; for all was one to him, oftentimes taking his iournie in disguised apparell, accompanied
onlie with one seruant. But to returne vnto the dooings in England.</p>

<p>In this yeare the king tooke escuage, fortie shillings of euerie knights f&eacute;e, towards the
charges of his last wars in Wales. &para; A parlement was holden at Westminster, at the
which were made the statutes called Additamenta Glocestri&aelig;, or rather the statutes of
Westminster the second. In the fouret&eacute;enth yeare of king Edward, a citizen of London
named Thomas Piwilesdon, who in time of the barons warres had b&eacute;ene a great dooer, to
stir the people against king Henrie, was now accused, that he with other should go about
to make new disturbance within the citie: whereof inquirie being made and had before
sir Rafe Standish, then custos or gardian of the citie, the said Piwilesdon and other, to the
number of fiftie, were banished the citie for euer. &para; Also, whereas of old time before
this season, the merchant strangers were vsed to be lodged within the dwelling houses of
the citizens of London, and sold all their merchandize by procuration of their hosts, for
the which their said hosts had a certeine allowance, after the rate of euerie pound: now
it was ordeined, that the said merchant strangers might take houses to hire, for to inhabit
therein, &amp; for stowage of their wares, &amp; no citizen to intermeddle with them or their
wares: by reason whereof they vsed manie deceits, both in vttering counterfeit wares,
and also vniust weights. Moreouer, much of those wares, which they should haue waied
at the K. beame, they weighed at home within their houses, to the hinderance of the
kings custome. Wherevpon search being made vpon a sudden, and their weights found
and prooued false, twentie of the said strangers were arrested and sent to the towre, and
their weights burnt, destroied and broken to p&eacute;eces in Westcheape, on thursdaie before
the feast of Simon and Iude. Finallie, the said merchants were deliuered, being put to a
fine of a thousand pounds, after sore and hard imprisonment.</p>

is reported that the commons of England granted to the king the fift part of their mooueables,
to haue the Iewes banished out of the land: but the Iewes, to put the Englishmen
fr&#x014D; their purpose, gaue to the king great summes of monie, whereby they tarried yet a

passing through Picardie vnto Amiens, and there the French king, to doo him honor, was
readie to receiue him. Here king Edward did homage vnto the French king, for the
lands which he ought to hold of him in France. And after, he was also present at a
parlement, which the said French king held at Paris, in the which he obteined manie
things for the liberties of his said lands, as then by diuerse waies wrongfullie oppressed,
though such grant continued not long in force. After Whitsuntide, king Edward departed

was with him in all his iournie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Variance betwixt the lord Paine Tiptost and Rice ap Meridoc.</div>

<p>This yeare the king went into Aragon, where his authoritie auailed much, in the making
of agr&eacute;ement betwixt the kings of Aragon and Naples; whereby Charles king of Naples
was then set at libertie, vpon certeine contracts or couenants passed and agr&eacute;ed betwixt
them. &para; The kings mother qu&eacute;ene Elianor this yeare forsooke the world, and tooke
vpon hir the habit of a nunne at Ambresburie; but yet she still reteined and inioied hir
dower by the popes authoritie and dispensation. About this time a squire called Chamberlaine,
with his complices, set fire on the merchants boothes, at S. Butolphes faire; and
whilest the merchants were about to quench the fire, the said squire and his complices
set vpon the said merchants, slue manie of them, and robbed them of their goods. In
this yeare fell variance betw&eacute;ene the lord Paine Tiptost, wardeine of certeine castels in
Wales, and a Welsh knight called sir R&eacute;es ap Meridoc, so that sundrie skirmishes were
foughten betwixt them, and men slaine on both sides, to the great disturbance of the
countrie.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>N. Triuet.</i></div>

<p>The cause of this warre rose ch&eacute;eflie, for that the said lord Tiptost, and the lord Alane
Plucknet, the kings steward in Wales, would haue constreined the said R&eacute;es to appeare at
counties and hundreds, as the vse in other parts of Wales then was, contrarie to such
liberties as he had obteined of the king as he pretended. But when the king wrote vnto
the same R&eacute;es, requiring him to k&eacute;epe the peace, till his returne (at what time he promised
to reforme all things in due and reasonable order). R&eacute;es hauing alreadie put armour
vpon his backe, would not now incline to any peace, but to reuenge his cause, assembled
a great multitude of Welshmen, with whose helpe he burnt &amp; destroied manie townes in
Wales so that the K. being then beyond the seas, sent to the earle of Cornewall, whom
in his absence he had appointed his lieutenant ouer England, requiring him to send an
armie into Wales, to resist the malice and riotous attempts of the Welshmen. The earle
shortlie therevpon prepared an armie, and went with the same into Wales, or (as other
write) the bishop of Elie, the lord prior of S. Iohns, the earle of Glocester, and diuerse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
barons of the land went thither, and chasing the said R&eacute;es, dispersed his armie, and ouerthrew
and raced his castels, but by vndermining and reuersing the wals at the castell of
Druslan, with the fall therof, the baron Stafford, and the lord William de Montchensie,
with manie other knights and esquiers, were oppressed and brused to death. &para; This

in breadth (as the author of the Chronicle of Dunstable affirmeth) ouerthrowing buildings,
and drowning vp men and cattell that could not auoid the danger by the sudden
comming in thereof, namelie, about Yarmouth, Dunwich, and Gippeswich. Likewise in
the Mers land of Lincolnshire it did passing great hurt, bringing all the countrie into
water. This chanced in the verie night of the beginning of this y&eacute;ere, to wit, in the feast

<p>Moreouer, whereas R&eacute;es ap Meridoc continued still in his mischieuous dooings, at
length, the lord deputie of Wales, Robert Tiptost, vsing both sp&eacute;edie diligence and timelie
counsell, gathered all such power as he could make, &amp; passed foorth against his aduersaries.
Whereof when sir R&eacute;es was aduertised, and vnderstanding that the Englishmen
were farre fewer in number than his Welshmen, he thought to ouerthrow them at his
pleasure, and therefore incouraging his people with manie comfortable words, to shew
their manhood vpon the Englishmens approch, he hasted to m&eacute;et them. The Welshmen
being for the more part but yoong souldiers, and not trained to k&eacute;epe any order of
battell, ran fiercelie vpon their enimies, assailing them on the front before, on the sides a
flanke, and on the backe behind, inforcing themselues to the vttermost of their power to
breake their arraie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Welsh discomfited. R&eacute;es ap Meridoc taken.</div>

in k&eacute;eping themselues close togither, and beating backe their aduersaries: and at length
perceiuing them to faint and wax wearie, they rushed foorth into the middle of the Welshmen,
&amp; brake them in sunder, so that when they saw themselues thus repelled by the
Englishmen, contrarie vnto all their expectation, they knew not what to doo, for they durst
neither fight nor fl&eacute;e, and so by that meanes were beaten downe on euerie side. Meridoc
himselfe was taken, but the most part of all his armie was slaine, to the number of foure
thousand men. Thus were the Welshmen woorthilie chastised for their rebellion. Sir
R&eacute;es ap Meridoc was had to Yorke, where at length, after the king was returned out of
Gascoigne, he was hanged, drawen and quartered.</p>

wooll, which should be sold vnto strangers, should be brought vnto Sandwich, where the
staple thereof was kept long time after. In the same yeare was a parlement holden at

decr&eacute;ed, that all the Iewes should auoid out of the land, in consideration whereof, a
fift&eacute;enth was granted to the king, and so h&eacute;ervpon were the Iewes banished out of all the
kings dominions, and neuer since could they obteine any priuilege to returne hither againe.
All their goods not mooueable were confiscated, with their taillies and obligations; but
all other their goods that were mooueable, togither with their coine of gold and siluer, the
king licenced them to haue and conuey with them. A sort of the richest of them, being
shipped with their treasure in a mightie tall ship which they had hired, when the same was

ship, whither he was drawne vp by a cord. The Iewes made not so much hast as he did,
bicause they were not ware of the danger. But when they perceiued how the matter stood,
they cried to him for helpe: howbeit he told them, that they ought to crie rather vnto
Moses, by whose conduct their fathers passed through the red sea, and therefore, if they
would call to him for helpe, he was able inough to helpe them out of those raging flouds,
which now came in vpon them: they cried ind&eacute;ed, but no succour appeared, and so they
were swallowed vp in water. The maister returned with the ship, and told the king how
he had vsed the matter, and had both thanks and reward, as some haue written. But
other affirme, (and more truelie as should s&eacute;eme) that diuerse of those mariners, which
dealt so wickedlie against the Iewes, were hanged for their wicked practise, and so receiued
a iust reward of their fraudulent and misch&eacute;euous dealing. But now to the purpose.</p>

<p>In the foresaid parlement, the king demanded an aid of monie of the spiritualtie, for
that (as he pretended) he meant to make a iournie into the holie land, to succour the
christians there: whervpon they granted to him the eleuenth part of all their mooueables.
He receiued the monie aforehand, but letted by other businesse at home, he went not
foorth vpon that iournie. In the ninet&eacute;enth yeare of king Edward qu&eacute;ene Elianor king
Edwards wife died vpon saint Andrews &eacute;euen at Herdebie, or Herdelie (as some haue)
n&eacute;ere to Lincolne, the king being as then on his waie towards the borders of Scotland:
but hauing now lost the iewell which he most est&eacute;emed, he returned towards London to
accompanie the corps vnto Westminster, where it was buried in S. Edwards chapell, at
the f&eacute;et of king Henrie the third. She was a godlie and modest princesse, full of pitie,
and one that shewed much fauour to the English nation, readie to rel&eacute;eue euerie mans
gr&eacute;efe that susteined wrong, and to make them fr&eacute;ends that were at discord, so farre as in
hir laie. In euerie towne and place, where the corps rested by the waie, the king caused
a crosse of cunning workmanship to be erected in remembrance of hir, and in the same
was a picture of hir ingrauen. Two of the like crosses were set vp at London, one at
Charing, and the other in Westcheape. Morouer, he gaue in almes euerie Wednesday
wheresoeuer he went, pence a p&eacute;ece, to all such poore folkes as came to demand the
same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The tenth of spirituall reuenues gr&#x0101;ted to the K.</div>

<p>About the same time, bicause the king should be the more willing to go into the holie
land, as he had promised to doo, hauing monie to furnish him foorth, the pope granted
vnto him the tenth of the church of England, Scotland and Ireland, according to the true
value of all the reuenues belonging vnto the same for six yeares. He wrote to the bishops
of Lincolne and Winchester, that the same tenth should be laid vp in monasteries and
abbeies, till the king was entred into the sea, called Mare Maggiore, forwards on his
iournie eastwards, and then to be paid to his vse. But the king afterwards caused the
collectors to make paiment to him of the same tenth gathered for thr&eacute;e yeares, and laid
vp in monasteries, although he set not one foot forward in that iournie, as letted through
other businesse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Controuersie about the crowne of Scotland.</div>

<p>Also, by reason of the controuersie which depended as then betwixt diuerse persons, as
competitors of the crowne of Scotland, he went into the north parts and kept his easter at
Newcastell, and shortlie after, called a parlement at Northampton; where, by the aduise
of the prelats and other of his councell, learned in both the lawes, vpon knowledge had by
search of records, and chronicles of ancient time, he caused all the prelats and barons of
Scotland to be called afore him, and there in the parish-church of Norham, he declared
vnto them his right to the superioritie of the kingdome of Scotland, and requiring of
them, that they would recognise the same, protesting that he would defend the right of his
crowne, to the shedding of his owne bloud, that a true certificat and information might
come to light of his title and rightfull claime, vnto the direct and supreme dominion ouer
the realme of Scotland.</p>

<p>He had caused verelie all the histories, chronicles, and monuments that were to be
found within England, Scotland and Wales, to be sought vp and perused, that it might be
knowen what right he had in this behalfe. Wherevpon it was found by the chronicles of
Marianus the Scot, William of Malmesburie, Roger Houeden, Henrie Huntington, Rafe
de Diceto, and others, that in the yeare of our Lord 910, K. Edward surnamed Senior,
or the elder, subdued to him the kings of Scots and Welshmen, so that in the yeare 921,
the same people chose the said Edward to be their king and patrone. And likewise in
the yeare 926, Athelstan king of England vanquished Constantine king of Scotland, and
permitted him yet to reigne vnder him. Moreouer, Edred the brother of Athelstan, and
king of England, ouercame the Scots and Northumbers, the which submitted themselues
to him and sware him fealtie. Also Edgar king of England vanquished Kineth
the son of Alpine king of Scotland, who sware fealtie to him. Likewise Cnute king
of England and Denmarke, in the 16 yeare of his reigne ouercame Malcolme
king of Scots, &amp; so became king of foure kingdoms, England, Scotland, Denmarke, and
Norwaie.</p>

<p>Furthermore, that blessed king S. Edward, gaue the kingdome of Scotland vnto Malcolme
the sonne of the king of Cumberland, to hold the same of him. Againe, William
Bastard the Norman conqueror, in the sixt yeare of his reigne vanquished Malcolme king
of Scotland, and receiued of him an oth of fealtie. Also, Will. Rufus did the like vnto
Malcolme king of Scots, and two of his sonnes that successiuelie reigned ouer that realme.
Also, Alexander succ&eacute;eded his brother Edgar in the kingdome of Scotland, by consent of
K. Henrie the first. Also Dauid king of Scotland did homage to K. Stephan, &amp; William
K. of Scots did homage to Henrie, the son of K. Henrie the second, when in his fathers
life time he was crowned; and againe, to Henrie the father in the 20 yeare of his reigne,
as by an agr&eacute;ement made betwixt them two it dooth appeare. Also, Roger Houeden
saith, that William king of Scotland came to his souereigne lord king Henrie into Normandie,
and likewise to king Richard, and moreouer to king Iohn at Lincolne, dooing to them
his homage. Also, in the chronicles of S. Albons it is found that Alexander king of Scotland
married at Yorke Margaret the daughter of king Henrie the third, in the 35 yeare of
his reigne, and did to him homage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">K. Edward recognised for superior lord of Scotland.</div>

<p>And further, when king Edward himselfe was crowned at Westminster, in the yeare of
our Lord 1274, being the second of his reigne, the last deceassed K. of Scotland, Alexander
the third of that name did homage vnto him at Westminster the morrow after the
coronation. All which homages and fealties thus done by sundrie kings of Scotland,
vnto sundrie kings of England, were directlie and most manifestlie prooued to be doone
for the realme of Scotland, and not onelie for the lands which they held of the kings of
England within England, as the Scotish writers would s&eacute;eme to colour the matter. But
things being then fresh in memorie, no such cauillation might be auerred. And so herevpon
king Edwards title being substantiallie prooued, he was recognised superiour lord of
Scotland, of all them that pretended title at that time to that kingdome, by writings thereof
made and confirmed vnder their seales, the which being written in French conteined

<p>But others affirme, that after long disputation in the matter, by order of king Edward,
there were appointed 80 ancient and graue personages, amongst the which were 30 Englishmen,
vnto whom (being sworne and admonished to haue God before their eies) authoritie
was giuen to name him that should be king. These 80 persons, after they had well
considered vnto whome the right apperteined, declared with one voice, that Iohn Balioll
was rightful king. King Edward allowed their sentence, and by his authoritie confirmed
vnto the same Iohn, the possession of the kingdome of Scotland, with condition that if
he did not gouerne that realme with iustice, then vpon complaint, the king of England
might put vnto his hand of reformation, as he was bound to doo by his right of superioritie,
that in him was inuested. Herevpon king Edward awarded foorth his writ of deliuerie
of seizine at the suit of the said I. Balioll, to William and Robert, bishops of S.
Andrewes and Glasco, to Iohn lord Comin, Iames lord Steward of Scotland, and to the
lord Brian Fitz Alane, wardens of Scotland, commanding them to deliuer vnto the said
Iohn Balioll the seizine and possession of that realme, sauing the rel&eacute;efes and debts due
to him of the issues and profits of the same realme, vnto the day of the date of the writ,
which was the ninet&eacute;enth day of Nouember, in the twentie yere of his reigne. Also there
was another writ made, and directed to such as had the k&eacute;eping of the castels in their
hands, in forme as followeth.</p>

for defense of the coasts thereabouts, two of them as they sailed alongst the coast
of Normandie, and fearing no hurt by enimies, were taken by the Norman fl&eacute;et, and

with them streight towards Normandie, and finding no ships of the Normans abroad in

vpon the Norman ships that laie there at anchor, slue manie of the mariners, &amp; tooke

<p>The Frenchmen to reuenge this act, prepared a nauie, and furnishing the same with
souldiers went foorth to the sea, to incounter the Englishmen: but yer they met, messengers
were sent to and fro, the Englishmen accusing the Frenchmen of truce-breaking, and
the Frenchmen againe requiring restitution of their goods taken from them by violence.
And now forsomuch as this businesse had b&eacute;ene mooued rashlie betwixt the Englishmen
and the Normans, without any commission of their princes, their minds therefore were not
so kindled in displeasure, but that there had b&eacute;en good hope of agr&eacute;ement betwixt them,

matter: but the iudges meaning nothing lesse than to trie out the truth of the cause,
admitted no reasons that the earle could alledge in his brothers behalfe, and so pronounced
king Edward a rebell, and decr&eacute;ed by arest, that he had forfeited all his right
vnto the duchie of Guien. These things thus doone, he sent priuie messengers vnto
Burdeaux, to procure the citizens to reuolt from the Englishmen, and appointed constable
of France the lord Arnold de Neale to follow with an armie, who coming thither
easilie brought them of Burdeaux vnder the French dominion, being alreadie minded to
reuolt through practice of those that were latelie before sent vnto them from the French

vnder subiection, partlie moued by the example of the ch&eacute;efe and head citie of all the

were in the countrie, after they perceiued that the people did thus reuolt to the French

they fled to a towne called the Rioll, which they fortified with all sp&eacute;ed. Thus saith

<div class="sidenote">Henrie earle of Lincolne.</div>

<p>Nicholas Triuet, writing hereof, declareth the beginning of this warre to be on this
manner. The English merchants being diuerslie vexed vpon the seas, made complaint
to the king for losse of their merchandize. The king sent Henrie Lacie earle of Lincolne
vnto the French king, instantlie requiring, that by his assent there might some waie
be prouided with sp&eacute;ed by them and their councell, for some competent remedie touching
such harmes and losses by sea as his people had susteind. In the meane time whilest
the earle taried for answer, a nauie of the parts of Normandie conteining two hundred
ships and aboue, being assembled togither, that they might the more boldlie assaile their
enimies, and the more valiantlie resist such as should encounter them, sailed into Gascoigne,
determining to destroie all those of their aduersaries that should come in their
waie. But as these Normane ships returned backe with wines, glorieng as it were that
they had got the rule of the sea onelie to themselues, they were assailed by thr&eacute;escore
English ships, which tooke them, &amp; brought them into England the friday before Whitsunday:
all the men were either drowned or slaine, those onelie excepted which made
shift to escape by botes. The newes hereof being brought into France, did not so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
mooue the king and the councell to woonder at the matter, as to take thereof great indignation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop of London sent with an answer vnto the French king.</div>

fauour in the French court touching his affairs that belonged to his countrie of Gascoigne.
The king of England hearing this message, tooke therein deliberation to answer, and then
sent the bishop of London, accompaned with other wise and discr&eacute;et persons into France,
to declare for answer vnto the French king and his councell as followeth; that is,
"Whereas the king of England hath his regall court without subiection to any man, if
there were therefore any persons that found themselues hurt or indamaged by his people,
they might come to his court, and vpon declaration of their receiued iniuries, they should
haue sp&eacute;edie iustice, and to the end they might thus doo without all danger, whosoeuer
minded to complaine, he would giue vnto them a safe conduct to come and go in safetie
thorough his land: but if this waie pleased not the French king, then he was content
there should be arbitrators chosen on both sides, who weieng the losses on both parts, might
prouide how to satisfie the complaints: and the king of England would for his part enter
into bonds by obligation to stand to and abide their order and iudgement herein, so that
the French king would likewise be bound for his part, and if any such doubt fortuned to
arise, which could not be decided by the said arbitrators, let the same be reserued vnto
the kings themselues to discusse and determine, and the king of England vpon a sufficient
safe conduct had, would come ouer to the French K. if he would come downe vnto any
hauen towne n&eacute;ere to the sea coast, that by mutuall assent an end might b&eacute;e had in the
businesse: but if neither this waie should please the French king nor the other, then let
the matter be committed to the order of the pope, to whom it apperteined to nourish concord
among christian princes; or bicause the s&eacute;e was as then void, let the whole colledge
of cardinals or part of them take order therein, as should be thought necessarie, that
strife and discord being taken awaie and remoued, peace might againe flourish betwixt
them and their people," as before time it had doone, and bring with it the blessings therevpon

vouchsafe to giue an answer to the English ambassadors earnestlie requiring the same.
Finallie, the French K. sent vnto the citie of Aniou, which is knowne to belong vnto the
dutchie of Guien, where he there caused the king of England to be cited to make his

of France to seize into his hands all the duchie of Guien, and either to take or to
expell all the king of Englands officers, souldiers, and deputies, which were by him placed
within the said duchie. The king a little before had sent thither a valiant knight, named
the lord Iohn saint Iohn, which had furnished all the cities, townes, castels, and places,

<p>In the mean time the king of England, desirous to be at quiet with the Frenchmen,
appointed his brother Edmund earle of Lancaster, as then soiourning in France, to go
vnto the French kings councell to procure some agr&eacute;ement, which both might be allowed
of the French king, and not be dishonorable vnto him. But when the earle could not
preuaile in his sute, he tooke his iournie towards England, vtterlie despairing to procure
any peace. But yer he came to the sea side, he was sent for backe againe by the two
qu&eacute;enes of France, Ione wife to king Philip, and Marie his mother in law, which promised
to frame some accord betw&eacute;ene the two kings, and so therevpon after diuerse communications
by them had in the matter with the said earle of Lancaster, at length it was
accorded, that for the sauing of the French kings honour, which s&eacute;emed to be touched by
things doone by the king of Englands ministers in Gascoigne, six castels should remaine
at the said kings pleasure, as Sanctes, Talemond, Turnhim, Pomeroll, Penne, and mount
Flaunton. Also there should be set a seruant or sergeant in the French kings name, in
euerie citie and castell within all the whole duchie of Guien, except Burdeaux, Baion,
and the Rioll. And further, hostages should be deliuered at the French kings pleasure,
of all ministers to be placed by the king of England in Gascoigne and other places
through all the country. These things doone, the French king should reuoke the summons
published and pronounced in the court of Paris against the king of England. Also
he shuld restore all the castels (his seruants being remooued which he had placed in the
same) togither with the pledges incontinentlie, at the request of the same qu&eacute;enes, or of
either of them. The king of England hauing a safe conduct should come to Amiens, that
there m&eacute;eting with the French king, peace and amitie might be confirmed betwixt them.
Then were there writings made and ingrossed touching the forsaid articles of agr&eacute;ement,
one part deliuered to the earle, sealed with the seales of the qu&eacute;enes, and other remained
with the foresaid qu&eacute;enes sealed with the seale of the earle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letters patents.</div>

<p>The king of England certified hereof, sent his letters patents, directed vnto all his
officers and ministers in Gascoigne, commanding them to obeie in all things the French
kings pleasure. These letters patents were first sent vnto the earle of Lancaster, that he
might cause them to be conueied into Gascoine when he should s&eacute;e time. The earle
hauing receiued those letters, doubting whether the French K. would obserue the agr&eacute;ement
which the qu&eacute;enes had made and concluded, or not; required of them that he
might heare the French king speake the word, that he would stand vnto that which they
had concluded. Wherevpon in the presence of the said earle and his wife Blanch qu&eacute;ene
of Nauar, mother to the French qu&eacute;ene, also of the duke of Burgoigne, Hugh V&eacute;ere
sonne to the earle of Oxenford, and of a chapline called sir Iohn Lacie, the French king
promised by the faith of a prince, that he would fulfill the promises of the said qu&eacute;enes, and
the couenants by them accorded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Geffrey Langley.</div>

<p>Herevpon a knight of the earles of Lancaster, called sir Geffrey de Langley, was
sp&eacute;edilie sent into Gascoigne with letters from the French king, directed to the conestable,
to call him back againe from his appointed enterprise. And the foresaid chapleine
sir Iohn Lacie was sent also thither with the letters patents of the king of England,
directed vnto his officers there, in forme as is aboue mentioned, whervpon the lord Iohn
saint Iohn the king of Englands lieutenant in Gascoigne, vnderstanding the conclusions
of the agr&eacute;ement, sold all such prouisions as he had made and brought into the cities,

<p>Within a few daies after, the earle of Lancaster required the qu&eacute;enes, that they would
call vpon the king to grant his safe conduct for the king of England, to reuoke the citation
or summons, to restore the lands taken from him; and to deliuer the pledges: but
the French king by the mouths of certeine knights sent vnto the earle, renounced all such
couenants as before had b&eacute;ene concluded. The earle of Lancaster then perceiuing that
both he and his brother king Edward were mocked thus at the French kings hands, returned
into England, and informed the king &amp; his councell from point to point of all the
matter. Herevpon a parlement being called at Westminster, at the which the king of
Scotland was present, it was decr&eacute;ed by the states, that those lands which were craftilie
taken so from the K. should be recouered againe by the sword. And the king herewith
sent vnto the French king a frier preacher named Hugh of Manchester, and a frier minor
called William de Gainesbourgh, both being wise and discr&eacute;et men, and doctours of
diuinitie, to declare vnto him, that sith he would not obserue such agr&eacute;ements as had
b&eacute;ene concluded betwixt their ancestours; and further had broken such couenants as
were now of late agr&eacute;ed vpon betwixt them, by the trauell of his brother Edmund earle

<p>About the same time did the king of England send the archbishop of Dubline, and the

of Romans, to whome was giuen a great summe of monie (as was said) vpon couenants,
that he should aid the king of England against the French king, with all his maine force,
and that neither of them should conclude peace with the said French king without consent
of the other. About the Ascension tide, king Edward staied the woolles of this land,
as well belonging to spirituall men as temporall men, till the merchants had fined with
him for the same, so that there was a subsidie paied for all sarpliers of wooll that went out
of the relme, and in semblable wise for felles and hides. He also sent an armie by sea
into Gascoigne, vnder the conduct of his nephew Iohn of Britaine that was earle of Richmond,
appointing to him as councellors, the lord Iohn saint Iohn, and the lord Robert
Tiptost; men of great wisdome, and verie expert in warlike enterprises.</p>

<p>The kings coffers by reason of furnishing foorth of this armie, and other continuall

March one of the kings treasurers, purposed with other mens losses to supplie that
want. He knew that in abbeies and churches was much monie kept in store, the which
if he commanded to be taken from thence, he thought that he should not commit any
offense, but rather doo a good d&eacute;ed, that the monie might come abroad to the vse of the
people, whereby the souldiers might be satisfied for their wages. Such capteins therefore,
as he appointed to worke the feat, placing their souldiers in euerie quarter through
the realme, made search at one time, in Iulie, at thr&eacute;e of the clocke in the afternoone,
for all such monie as was hid and laid vp in all hallowed places, and taking the same
awaie, brought it vnto the king, who dissembling the matter, as he that stood in n&eacute;ed,
excused the act doone by his treasurer so well as he could, to auoid the enuie of the
people; and not content herewith, he called togither shortlie after, to wit, on saint
Matthewes day the apostle, at London, all the archbishops, bishops, deanes, &amp; archdeacons,
not in their proper persons, but by two procurators of euerie diocesse. Here
when they were once assembled, the king declared vnto them the warres which he was
driuen to mainteine against the Frenchmen, &amp; the charges which he was at for the same.
He also shewed them, that the earles, barons &amp; knights of the realme, did not onlie aid
him with their goods, but put their persons forward to serue him in defense of the land,
whereof they were members, euen to the shedding of their bloud, and oftentimes with losse

wist not well how to gouerne themselues. At length Oliuer bishop of Lincolne, required
in all their names to haue thr&eacute;e daies respit to make answer to the matter, the which time
expired, they offered to the king two dismes to be paid within one yeare. The which
when the king heard, he tooke great disdaine therewith, and threatned by some of his
men of war to put the cleargie out of his protection, except they would grant to him the
halfe of their goods. The cleargie put in feare herewith, and some of them also desirous
to win the kings fauour, granted his request, and so the king at that time got the halfe part
of euerie spirituall mans liuing and benefice for one yeares extent, to be paid in portions
within thr&eacute;e yeares next insuing, beginning at twentie marks benefice, &amp; so vpwards. And

<p>The bishops taking councell togither, required of him that the statute of Mortmain
might be repealed, which they saw to be most preiudiciall to their order. But the king
answered them, that without the whole consent of a parlement he could not breake that
ordinance, which by authoritie of parlement had b&eacute;ene once established, and therefore he
wished that they would not require that thing which laie not in him to grant, and so by
that means he shifted them off. The spiritualtie was not onelie charged with this subsidie,
but they of the temporaltie were also burthened. For the citizens and burgesses of good

<p>Moreouer, about the same time, the Welshmen eftsoones rebelled against the king, and
in diuerse parts made diuerse rulers amongst them. Those of Northwales which inhabited
about Snowdon hils, hauing to their capteine one Madoc, of the line of their former prince
Leolin, burned the towne and castell of Carnaruan, sleaing a great multitude of Englishmen,
which doubting no such matter, were come thither to the faire. Those of the west
part hauing chosen to their ruler one Malgon on the parts of Penbroke and Carmardin
shires, did much misch&eacute;efe. And one Morgan hauing them of Southwals at his commandement,
expelled and droue the earle of Glocester out of his countrie of Glamorgan,
which earle had before time disherited the ancestors of the same Morgan. The king
therefore to represse the Welshmens attempts, called backe his brother Edmund earle of

<p>The king kept his Christmasse at Aberconwey in Wales, and hearing that the new
archbishop of Canturburie, doctor Robert Winchelsey, being returned from Rome (where,
of pope Celestine he had receiued his pall) was comming towards him, he sent one of his
chapleines named Iohn Berwike with a power of souldiers to conduct him safelie vnto his
presence. And after the archbishop had doone his fealtie to the king, accordinglie as of
dutie and custome he was bound, he was licenced to returne with great honour shewed
vnto him at the kings hands. Vpon the day of the circumcision of our Lord, was the
citie of Baion rendred vnto the lord Iohn saint Iohn, the which the day before had b&eacute;ene
taken by the mariners by force of assault. Manie of the citizens which were knowne to
be ch&eacute;efe enimies vnto the king of England, were apprehended and sent into England.
The castell was then besieged, and after eight daies taken. The lord of Aspermont with
diuerse others that held it, were committed to prison. There were also taken two gallies,
which the French king had caused to be made, and appointed to be remaining there vpon
defense of that citie. Shortlie after the towne of saint Iohn de Sordes was deliuered vnto
the Englishmen, who wan manie other townes and fortresses, some by surrender of their
owne accord, and some by force and violence. The English armie greatlie increased
within a while, after the deceit of the Frenchmen once appeared, for the Gascoins returned
vnto the English obedience, in such wise that foure thousand footmen and two hundred
horsemen came to aid the English capteins.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abington.</i></div>

<p>In the meane time, the king of England passing ouer the riuer of Conwey, with part of
his armie to go further into Wales towards Snowdon, lost manie carts and other cariages
which were taken by the Welshmen, being loden with the prouisions of vittels, so that he
with his people indured great penurie, and was constreined to drinke water mixt with
honie, and eat such course bread and salt flesh as he could get, till the other part of the
armie came vnto him. There was a small quantitie of wine amongst them, which they
would haue reserued onelie for the king, &amp; therfore refused to tast therof. But least they
should repine at his extraordinarie and seuerall fare, and so by conceits of discontentment
for not hauing the like, he considered in a sympathie, that,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Qu&aelig; mala cum multis patimur, leuiora videntur,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>saieng, that in time of necessitie all things ought to be common, and all men to be contented
with like diet. For as touching him (being the cause and procurer of their want)
he would not be preferred before any of them in his meats and drinks. The Welshmen
compassed him about in hope to distresse him, for that the water was so risen, that the
residue of his armie could not get to him. But shortlie after, when the water fell, they
came ouer to his aid, and therewith the aduersaries fled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Welshmen ouerthrowne by the earle of Warwike.</div>

<p>The earle of Warwike, hearing that a great number of Welshmen was assembled togither,
and lodged in a vallie betwixt two woods, he chose out a number of horssemen, with
certeine crossebowes and archers, and comming vpon the Welshmen in the night, compassed
them round about, the which pitching the ends of their speares in the ground, and
turning the points against their enimies, stood at defense so to k&eacute;epe off the horssemen.
But the earle hauing placed his battell so, that euer betwixt two horssemen there stood a
crosbow, a great part of the Welshmen which stood at defense in maner aforesaid with
their speares, were ouerthrowne and broken with the shot of the quarels, and then the
earle charged the residue with a troope of horssmen, and bare them downe with such
slaughter, as they had not susteined the like losse of people (as was thought) at anie one

<div class="sidenote">Welshmen imprisoned.</div>

<p>In the meane while, king Edward to restreine the rebellious attempts of those Welshmen,
caused the woods of Wales to be cut downe, wherein before time the Welshmen were
accustomed to hide themselues in time of danger. He also repared the castels and holds
in that countrie, and builded some new, as the citie and castell of Bewmarise with other, so
that the Welshmen constreined through hunger and famine, were inforced within a while
to come to the kings peace. Also at length about the feast of saint Laurence, the Welshman
Madoc, that tooke himselfe for prince of Wales was taken prisoner, and being brought
to London was committed to perpetuall prison. &para; By some writers it should appeare,
that Madoc was not taken, but rather after manie aduentures &amp; sundrie conflicts, when
the Welshmen were brought to an issue of great extremitie, the said Madoc came in and
submitted himselfe to the kings peace, and was receiued, vpon condition that he should
pursue Morgan till he had taken him and brought him to the kings prison, which was
doone, and so all things in those parts were set in rest and peace, and manie hostages of
the ch&eacute;efest amongst the Welsh nobilitie were deliuered to the king, who sent them to
diuerse castels in England where they were safelie kept almost to the end of the warres
that followed with Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Earle of Richmond.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Rion besieged.</div>

<p>About the same time Charles de Valois brother to the French king, being sent with an
armie into Gascoine, and comming vpon the sudden, found the Englishmen wandering
abroad in the countrie out of order, by reason whereof taking them at that aduantage, he
caused them to leaue their booties behind them, slue part of them, and chased the residue,
the which fled to their ships, or to such hauen townes as were in their possession. The
capteins of the Englishmen, as Iohn de Britaine earle of Richmond, and the lord Iohn
saint Iohn, after they had got togither their souldiers which had b&eacute;ene thus chased, sent
two bands vnto Pontesey to defend that towne against the enimies: also other two bands
vnto saint Seuere: and they themselues went to Rion to fortifie that place. Charles de
Valois aduertised hereof, thought he would not giue them long respit to make themselues
strong by gathering any new power, and therfore appointed the conestable sir Rafe de
Neale, (who had woone the citie of Burdeaux from the Englishmen latelie before) to go
vnto Pontesey and besiege that towne, whilest he went vnto Rion, which he besieged and
fiercelie assaulted. But the Englishmen and Gascoins did not onelie defend the towne
stoutlie, but also made an issue foorth vpon their enimies, though (as it happened) the
smaller number was not able to susteine the force of the greater multitude, and so were
the Englishmen beaten backe into the towne againe.</p>

<p>Whilest they tried their manhood thus at Rion, the constable woone Pontesey or Pontsac
vpon Dordone, and came to ioine with the earles de Valois at Rion, and so inforced
both their powers to win that towne. The Englishmen and Gascoins, though they were
put in some feare, yet they shewed their approoued valiancie in defending the towne, till
at length when they saw they could defend it no longer, and were in no hope of succour
from anie part, they fled out about midnight, and made toward their ships: but diuerse of
them were taken by the waie, for the Frenchmen hauing knowledge of their intent, forlaie
the passages, and taking some of them that first sought to escape thus by flight, slue them,
but there was not manie of those. For all the residue, when they perceiued that the
Frenchmen had laid betwixt them and their ships, making vertue of necessitie, stood still
in defense of the towne, till the Frenchmen entred it by force of assault the friday in

chanced a great tumult and mutenie betwixt the footmen and horssemen, so that they
fought togither, or else might the whole number of them haue escaped. The horssemen
that got foorth left their horsses behind them readie brideled and sadled, which the Frenchmen
vpon entring the towne in the morning tooke, after they had slaine the most part of
the footmen. The Frenchmen hauing got a bloudie victorie, saued onelie the capteins
and gentlemen, and slue the other, aswell Englishmen as Gascoins. There was taken of
knights, sir Rafe Tannie, sir Amis de saint Amand, with his brother sir Rafe de Gorges

<p>On the same day was the towne of saint Seuere deliuered vnto the Englishmen, the
which Hugh or (as Abington saith) Robert V&eacute;er, brother to the earle of Oxenford tooke
vpon him to k&eacute;epe as capteine there with two hundred men of armes. Charles de Valois
aduertised thereof, departed from Rion with all sp&eacute;ed, to besiege the foresaid towne of
saint Seuere, yer the Englishmen should haue time to fortifie it. But the foresaid Hugh
V&eacute;er kept him out the space of thirt&eacute;ene or (as Abington saith) nine w&eacute;ekes, to the great
losse of the Frenchmen, no small part of their people dieng in the meane time, both of
pestilence and famine. At length, when vittels began to faile within, a truce was taken
for fift&eacute;ene daies, within the which it might be lawfull for them within the towne to send
vnto Baion for succour, which if it came not within that tearme, the towne should be
y&eacute;elded vnto the Frenchmen, and so it was vpon these conditions, that the Englishmen
and other that would depart, should haue libertie to take with them their armour and
goods, and be safelie conueied two daies iornie on their waie from the French armie.
Also that those which were minded to remaine still in the towne, should not susteine any
losse or damage in their bodies or goods. The pledges also which aforetime were taken
out of that towne by the French kings seneshall, should returne in safetie to the towne,
and haue their goods restored vnto them. This doone, Charles de Valois appointed a
garrison of soldiers to remaine there for the k&eacute;eping of the towne, and then returned
backe into France. The Englishmen, which escaped out of those places from the
Frenchmens hands, repaired vnto Baion, to defend that towne with their capteins the
foresaid earle of Richmond and the lord Iohn de S. Iohn, the which of some are
vntruelie said to haue b&eacute;ene slaine at Rion. Shortlie after that Charles de Valois was
departed and gone out of the countrie, the towne of saint Seuere was recouered by the

saie; howbeit about the 27 yeare of this king Edwards reigne, we find one Hugh V&eacute;er,
that was a baron, whom I take to be this man, but earle I thinke he was not. For (as

heard) which were taken at Rion, to saue his life, and to deliuer himselfe out of captiuitie,
though he was neuer proued false before, promised king Philip that if he would
suffer him to returne into England, he would so worke with king Edward, that he might
be made by him admerall of the seas; which thing brought to passe he would deliuer the
English nauie into the hands of the said king Philip. Herevpon was he set at libertie,
and ouer he came into England. And for as much as he had knowne to be a man of singular
and approued valiancie, king Edward receiued him verie courteouslie, who remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>bring
his promised practise to the French king, fell in hand by procuring of fr&eacute;ends to be

<p>The French king in the meane time hauing prepared his nauie, conteining thr&eacute;e hundred
saile, what with the gallies and other ships (for he had got diuerse both from Merselles
and Genoa) sent the same foorth to the seas, that vpon such occasion the king of England
might also send foorth his fl&eacute;et. But the French nauie comming n&eacute;ere to the coast
of England, and lieng at anchor certeine daies, looking for Thomas Turberuile; when he
came not at the day prefixed, the capteines of the French fl&eacute;et appointed one of their vessels
to approch n&eacute;ere to the shore, and to set on land certeine persons that knew the countrie,
to vnderstand and learne the cause of such staie. They being taken of the Englishmen
and examined, could make no direct answer in their owne excuse, and so were put
to death. Some write that they sent fiue gallies towards the shore to suruey the coast, of
the which gallies one of them aduansing foorth afore hir fellowes, arriued at Hide n&eacute;ere to
Romney hauen, where the Englishmen espieng hir, to draw the Frenchmen on land,
feined to flie backe into the countrie, but returning suddenlie vpon the enimies, they slue
the whole number of them, being about two hundred and fiftie persons. They set fire on

<p>The admerall of the French fl&eacute;et kindled in anger herewith, sailed streight vnto Douer,
and there landing with his people, robbed the towne and priorie. The townesmen being
striken with terror and feare of the sudden landing of their enimies, fled into the countrie,
and raised people on euerie side, the which being assembled togither in great numbers, towards
euening came to Douer, and inuading such Frenchmen as were straied abroad to
s&eacute;eke preies, slue them downe in sundrie places. The French admerall which had b&eacute;ene
busie all the day in pilfering the towne, hearing the noise of those Frenchmen that came
running towards the sea side, streightwaies got him to his ships with such pillage as he
could take with him. The other Frenchmen, which were gone abroad into the countrie to
fetch preies, and could not come to their ships in time, were slaine euerie mothers sonne.
Some of them hid themselues in the corne fields, and were after slaine of the countrie
people. There was little lesse than eight hundred of them thus slaine by one meane and
other at that time. There were not manie of the men of Douer slaine, for they escaped
by swift flight at the first entrie made by the Frenchmen: but of women and children there
died a great number, for the enimies spared none. There was also an old moonke slaine
named Thomas, a man of such vertue (as the opinion went) that after his deceasse, manie

<p>Sir Thomas Turberuile, being troubled in his mind that he could not bring his traitorous
purpose to passe, began to assaie another waie, which was to procure Iohn Balioll king
of Scotland to ioine in league with the French king, but yer any of his practises could be
brought about, his treason was reuealed, who being thereof euidentlie conuicted, was put
to execution. Nich. Triuet saith, that he had promised the French king to cause Wales
to reuolt from king Edward, and that by procurement of the prouost of Paris, he consented
to worke such treason. And (as some write) he did not onelie homage vnto the
French king, but also left two of his sonnes in pledge for assurance to worke that which
he had promised. His secretarie that wrote the letters vnto the French king, conteining
his imagined treasons, with other aduertisements touching king Edwards purposes, fearing
least the matter by some other means might come to light (as the old prouerb saith,</p>

<p>as well to his destruction as his maisters for concealing it, disclosed all to the king. Now
he hauing knowledge that he was bewraied by his seruant, fled out of the court, but such
diligence was vsed in the pursuit of him, that he was taken within two daies after, and
brought backe againe to London, where he was conuicted of the treason so by him imagined,

<p>Iohn king of Scotland affianced his sonne Edward Balioll with the daughter of Charles

against the king of England. Nothing mooued the Scotish king so much hereto, as the
affection which he bare towards his natiue countrie, for he was a French man borne, and
lord of Harecourt in Normandie, which segniorie was after made an earledome by Philip
du Valois king of France. The Scotishmen had chosen 12 p&eacute;eres, that is to saie, foure
bishops, foure earles, and foure barons, by whose aduise and counsell the king should
gouerne the realme, by whome he was induced also to consent vnto such accord with

<p>King Edward not fullie vnderstanding the conclusion of this league, required aid of
the Scotish king for the maintenance of his warres against France, and receiuing a doubtfull
answer, began to suspect the matter: whervpon he required to haue thr&eacute;e castels,
as Barwike, Edenburgh, and Rokesburgh, deliuered vnto him as gages till the end of the
warre, and if the Scotishmen continued faithfull vnto him, he would then restore the same
castels to them againe when the warres were ended. This to do the Scotishmen vtterlie
denied, alledging that their countrie was fr&eacute;e of it selfe, and acquit of all seruitude or
bondage, and that they were in no condition bound vnto the king of Scotland, and therefore
they would receiue the merchants of France, of Flanders, or any other countrie without

<p>There were in the hauen of Berwike at the same time, certeine English merchants, vpon
whome the Scots made assault, and wounded some of them, and some of them they slue,
and chased the residue, the which returning into England, made complaint, and shewed
in what euill maner they had b&eacute;ene dealt with. King Edward h&eacute;erevpon perceiuing the
purposes of the Scots, determined to make warre vpon them with all sp&eacute;ed, &amp; to conquer
the whole countrie, if they could not cleare themselues of such euill dealing as of them
was reported and thought to be put in practise. About the conuersion of saint Paule in
Ianuarie, king Edward sent ouer into Gascoine his brother the lord Edmund earle of Lancaster,
with the earle of Lincolne and other, to the number of 26 banerets, and 700 men
of armes, besides a great multitude of other people. They arriued at Blay, about the
midst of Lent, and staied there till towards Easter. In which meane season, a great sort

the Englishmen at vnwares: but hauing warning, they prepared themselues to battell, so
well as the shortnes of time would permit, and so therevpon incountring with their enimies,
and fighting a sore battell, at length constreined the French men to returne vnto the
citie, and pursuing them as they fled, two English knights being brethren to sir Peter de
Mallow and an other that was a Gascoine, entred the citie with two standard bearers belonging
to the earle of Richmond, &amp; to the lord Alane de la Zouch, whom the Frenchmen
tooke, closing them within the gates. The other Englishmen being shut out, first fell to
the spoile of the suburbs, and then set fire vpon the same. After this were certeine of the
citizens that secretlie were at a point with the earle of Lancaster, to haue deliuered the

Margaret countesse of Flanders, whom she had by hir second husband William lord of
Dampire in Burstoine. Also king Edward procured Henrie earle of Bar, to whome (as
before ye haue heard) he had giuen his daughter Eleanor in marriage, to make warre
vpon the Frenchmen, so that at one time the erle of Bar inuaded the countrie of Champaigne,
and the earle of Flanders made incursions vpon those countries of France which
ioine vnto Flanders. King Philip hereof aduertised, sent forth one Walter de Cressie
with a great armie against the earle of Bar, so that besieging the ch&eacute;efest towne of Bar,
he constreined the said earle to leaue off his enterprise in Champaigne, and to returne

<p>But now to touch more at large the circumstances of the occasion that mooued the earle
of Flanders to make war against the French king. I find (in Iacob Meir) that there was
a marriage concluded betwixt the lord Edward the eldest son of king Edward, and the
ladie Philip daughter to the foresaid Guie earle of Flanders, which marriage was concluded
by Henrie bishop of Lincolne, and the earle Warren, being sent ouer as ambassadours
by king Edward, vnto the said earle Guie for the same purpose. In the yeare following,
the said earle of Flanders, togither with his wife, comming to visit the French king
at Corbeill, were arrested, and sent to Paris, there to remaine as prisoners, bicause that
the earle had affianced his daughter to the French kings aduersarie, without his licence
neither might they be deliuered, till by mediation of the pope (who must n&eacute;eds meddle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>

which was so affianced vnto K. Edwards sonne, and further couenanted, not to conclude
any league with the king of England, but in all points t'obserue a certeine peace which
was concluded with Ferdinando earle of Flanders, in the yeare 1225. And if earle Guie
brake the same peace, then should he be excommunicated, and all his countrie of Flanders
interdicted by the archbishop of Reims, and the bishop of Senlis, iudges appointed
herein by authoritie of the pope.</p>

<p>The earles daughter being sent for, and brought vnto Paris, the earle and his wife were
released, and suffered to returne into Flanders, and shortlie after, the earle made earnest
suit to haue his daughter restored vnto him againe, insomuch that he procured pope
Boniface to be a meane for him to the French king; but all would not serue, no, though as
some say the pope accurssed the French king for reteining hir, answer being made, that matters
perteining to worldlie gouernment, belonged not to the pope to discusse. Finallie,
earle Guie, perceiuing he could not preuaile in that suit, to haue his daughter againe, vpon
high displeasure concluded to ioine in league with king Edward &amp; his confederats. Herevpon,
at an assemblie or councell kept at Gerardmount, there was a solemne league made and
agr&eacute;ed betwixt Adolph the emperour of Almaine, Edward king of England, Guie earle of
Flanders, Iohn duke of Brabant, Henrie earle of Bar, both sonnes in law to king Edward,
and Albert duke of Austrich, against Philip king of France, and Iohn earle of Henault his
partaker.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. West.</i></div>

<p>The merchants of Flanders procured the earle to conclude this league with king Edward,
as some write, the rather in respect of the great commodities which rose to their countrie,
by reason of the intercourse of merchandize vsed betwixt England and Flanders, and for
that through aid of the Englishmen, they might the better withstand the malice, both of
the French and of all other their enimies. This league being proclaimed in England,
there were sent ouer into Flanders, the treasurer of the excheker, and diuerse other noble
men, to fetch hostages from thence, and to giue to the earle fift&eacute;ene thousand pounds of
siluer, towards the fortifieng of his castels and holds. King Philip being hereof aduertised,
by counsell of the p&eacute;eres of his realme, sent two honorable personages, as the capteine
of Mounstrell, and the capteine of Belquerke, which should attach the earle of Flanders
by his bodie, and summon him to y&eacute;eld himselfe prisoner at Paris, within the space

letters procuratorie, to authorise them thereto, dated at Male in the yeare of Grace
1296, after the accounts of the chronicles of Flanders, which begin their yere at Easter:
and so this chanced in the fiue and twentith yeare of king Edwards reigne, the Wednesdaie
next after the feast of the Epiphanie. Herevpon was the earle accurssed, &amp; Flanders
interdicted by the archbishop of Reims, and the bishop of Senlis comming vnto
Terwane for that purpose, about the fift&eacute;enth day of Iune, in the yeare 1297. But the
lord Robert the earles sonne appealed from that interdiction to the pope, and so the
Flemmings tooke themselues fr&eacute;e &amp; out of danger of the same. Earle Guie also
obteined of king Edward, that it might be lawfull for them of Bruges to buy wools,
through England, Scotland and Ireland, as fr&eacute;elie as the Italians might by their priuilege
and grant.</p>

<p>But to returne now to the dooings of king Edward, who in this meane time, hauing a
perfect knowledge of the league concluded betwixt the king of France and the king of
Scotland, prepared an armie, and first sent ambassadors into Scotland, to giue summons
to king Iohn to appeare at Newcastell within certeine daies, that he might there shew the
cause whie he had broken the league: and further, to declare vnto him that he was deceiued,

<p>For how much fauour as he purchased at the hands of the French king, so much displeasure
might he assure himselfe to procure at the hands of the king of England, whome
to obeie, it should be most for his aduantage. The ambassadors that were sent, did their
message throughlie, but king Iohn was so farre off from answering anie thing that might
sound to the maintenance of peace, that shortlie after he sent letters of complaint vnto king
Edward, for wrongs which he alledged he had susteined by his means and at his hands.

called Prestfen, were slaine by the Scotishmen of the garison of Rockesborough, that were
led and guided by the said Robert Ros: some of them although but few escaped awaie by
flight. King Edward aduertised hereof, hasted foorth, and came to the said castell, glad
of this (as is reported) that the Scotishmen had first begun the warre, meaning, as it should
s&eacute;eme by their proc&eacute;edings, to follow the same, for vpon Good friday, diuerse Scotishmen

so the flames catching hold vpon the other buildings, a great part of the citie was thereby

the English armie was placed in battell raie, vpon a plaine, the king making there certeine
knights, they thought his meaning was to haue giuen forthwith an assalt, and so entring the
hauen, and approching to the land, began to fight with the townesmen, where they lost
foure of their ships, and were constreined to withdraw with the residue, with helpe of the
falling water. Some haue written that they lost but thr&eacute;e ships which were consumed
with fire, and that the mariners and souldiers of one of those ships, after they had defended
themselues by great manhood from the first houre of the daie, till eleuen of the clocke,
escaped awaie, some by the bote of that ship, and some leaping into the water, were saued
by the botes of other ships that made in to succour them.</p>

<p>The rumor of the mariners attempt being bruted through the armie, the king passing

and so comming to the towne, wan it not losing any man of renowme, sauing sir
Richard Cornewall, the which was slaine by a quarell which a Flemming shot out of a
crossebowe, being in the red hall, which the merchants of Flanders held in that towne, and
had fortified it in manner of a tower: but when they would not y&eacute;eld, and could not easilie
otherwise be woone, the house towards euening was set on fire, and so they being thirtie in
number were burned to death within it. Vpon the same night, the king lodged in the
castell, which was y&eacute;elded vnto him by them that kept it, their liues and limmes saued, and
receiuing an oth, that they should not from thencefoorth beare armour against the king
of England, they were permitted to depart whither they thought good, their capteine sir
William Dowglas excepted, whom the king still kept with him, till the end of the warres.
Some write that there should be slaine of Scotishmen at this winning of Berwike, aboue

twentie of all sorts. Y&eacute;e may read more hereof in the Scotish historie.</p>

<p>&para; But before I passe ouer this slaughter, so lamentable and woonderfull, I haue bethought
my selfe of a promised apologie for and in the behalfe of Richard Grafton, mentioned
before in the reigne of Henrie the second, page 194 where I shewed how
vnaduisedlie and with vns&eacute;emelie modestie for a man of learning, George Buchanan the
Scot dooth shoot his bolts at the said Grafton, as now by occasion of the matter conuenientlie
occurrent shall be shewed. The said Grafton in his large volume of English
chronicles, falling vpon the affaires betw&eacute;ene king Edward the first, and Iohn Balioll king
of Scotland, among other things there remembred, maketh report that in the said battell
of Berwike, the slaughter was so great, that a mill might well haue b&eacute;ene driuen by the
space of two daies, with the streames of bloud which at that time ouerranne the ground.
At which words George Buchanan giueth a snatch, emboldened so to doo, bicause the
said Grafton referreth this record to Hector Boetius in his fourt&eacute;enth booke and second
chapter.</p>

<p>Iesu, how the Scot taketh vp the Englishman for halting in his allegation, first for the
chapter, conuincing him that Hector Boetius diuided not his booke into chapters, and
therefore, where is the second chapter, sith the whole fourt&eacute;en booke is a continued discourse
without distinction by chapters? Secondlie the said Grafton hath the checke, for
setting a lie aflote, Buchanan flatlie affirming that Hector Boetius hath no such matter
once mentioned in his annales. Touching the first fault, wherewith the Scot chargeth the
Englishman, this is note-worthie, that it should s&eacute;eme to anie man of meane iudgement,
that Buchanan of a prepensed malice and purposed wilfulnesse hath sharpened his stile in
this nipping sort against Grafton. For sith it was Graftons meaning to record the truth,
so farre foorth as he was warranted by the auerment of writers; why should he be cast in
the t&eacute;eth with Effr&aelig;nis maledicendi libido, or dishonestlie termed Indoctus &amp; impudenter
mendax? Which opprobrious epithets, if they were deserued by an vntrue report of the
author; then should Buchanan haue sharpened his toong against Belenden his countriman,
the translator of Hector Boetius into their mother toong, from whom Grafton hath
deriued his words; sense for sense vnmangled (as he found the same written.)</p>

<p>Now who knoweth not that Bellenden distinguished Hectors annales into chapters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
vpon whose authoritie Grafton relieng, and citing his authoritie according to the quotation
of his diuision, whie should he rather than Bellenden be barked at, who is the principall
in this controuersie? Againe, it could not be hidden from Buchanan, that Bellenden
had distributed Boetius into chapters; considering that they were &#963;&#8059;&#947;&#967;&#961;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#953;, both
liuing in the reigne of Iames the fift of that name king of Scots: so that it might haue
pleased him to haue tried Grafton by the Scotish Boetius, and so to haue b&eacute;ene resolued
for the second chapter of the fouret&eacute;enth booke, according to the archdeacon of
Murries translation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Hector Boetius, pag. 294, lib. impress. Parisijs &agrave; Iacobo du Puys, 1574.</i></div>

<p>Now for the matter itselfe, touching the effusion of bloud, wherewith a mill might well
haue b&eacute;ene driuen for two daies space; Hector Boetius his owne words are these; Riui
sanguinis toto oppido adeo fluxere, vt cum &aelig;stu decurrente minor aqua qu&agrave;m ad molendina
circumagenda fuerit, adiuuante aquam sanguine aliqua circumagi sponte c&oelig;perint.
Which place, Bellenden hath interpreted after this manner; So lamentabl' slaughter wes
throw all the parts of the toun, that ane mill might haif gane two daies ithandlie be stremis
of blude. Now examine Graftons words by Bellenden, and Bellendens by Boetius
(besides that, marke what Grafton annexeth to the report of this slaughter, who saith that
he will not inforce the credit therof vpon any man, but counteth it a Scotish lie rather than
a matter of truth) and then conclude according to equitie, that Grafton is altogither excusable
and fautlesse, and Buchanans curious &amp; furious challenge reproueable. But
admit Grafton had fetcht his report from Boetius, as he had it from Bellenden; s&eacute;emeth
it a lie or an vnlikelihood, that the bloud gushing out of the bodies of 25000, or (as
Hector Boetius saith) 7000, would not increase to a streame sufficient &amp; able to driue a
mill or two about, without any water intermingled therwithall. The Latine copie hath
Riui sanguinis, riuers of bloud, noting by the word the abundance and also the streaming
course of the same, which was able with the violent current thereof to beare awaie the
verie bodies of the slaine. To conclude this matter, &amp; to set our Englishman by the truth,
and let the Scot go with his lieng toong, which I would he had had the modestie to haue
tempered, &amp; to haue proffered a practise of that which himselfe paraphrasticallie preacheth
and teacheth others to obserue, saieng;</p>

<p>And now to the storie. K. Edward remaind at Berwike 15 daies, &amp; caused a ditch to
be cast about the towne of 80 foot in breadth, &amp; of the like in depth. In the meane time,
about the beginning of Aprill, the warden and reader of the frier minors of Rockesborough
called Adam Blunt, came vnto him with letters of complaint from king Iohn, for the wrongs
doone and offered vnto him and his realme, as well in claiming an vniust superioritie, and
constreining him to doo homage by vndue and wrongfull meanes, as also by inuading his
townes, slaieng and robbing his subiects: for the which causes he testified by the same
letters, that he renounced all such homage and fealtie for him and his subiects, as he, or
any of them owght for any lands holden within England. The king hearing the letters red
receiued the resignation of the homage, and commanded his chancellor, that the letter
might be registred in perpetuall memorie of the thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Boghan. The crueltie of the Scots.</div>

<p>The earles of Scotland before remembred, being assembled togither with their powers
at the castell of Iedworth, entred into England the eighth of Aprill, and with fire and
sword did much hurt in the countries as they passed. In Riddesdale they besieged the
castell of Harbotell by the space of two daies, but when they could not preuaile, they
remoued, and passing foorth by the east part of the riuer of Tine, thorough Cokesdale,
Riddesdale, and Northumberland, vnto Hexham, they did much misch&eacute;efe by burning
and harrieng the countries. At Hexham they spoiled the abbeie church, and got a great
number of the cleargie, as well moonks, priests, as scholers, and others, whom they thrust
into the schoolehouse there, and closing vp the dores, set fire on the schoole, and burned
all them to ashes that were within it. It is wonderfull to read, what beastlie crueltie the
Scots vsed in that road which they made at that time in two seuerall parts. For the earle
of Boghan, with them of Galloway, entred by Cumberland in like manner as the other
did in Riddesdale, burning and murthering all that came in their waie. For whereas all
those that were of able age and lustie to get awaie, fled, &amp; escaped their hands; the aged
&amp; impotent creatures, women in childbed, and yoong children that could not shift for themselues,
were vnmercifullie slaine, and thrust vpon speares, and shaken vp in the aire,
where they y&eacute;elded vp their innocent ghosts in most pitifull wise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nunrie of Lamelaie burnt.</div>

<p>Churches were burned, women were forced without respect of order, condition or qualitie,
as well the maids, widowes and wiues, as nunnes that were reputed in those daies
consecrated to God, and when they had b&eacute;ene so abused, manie of them were after also
murthered, and cruellie dispatched out of life. At length, they came to the nunrie of
Lamelaie, &amp; burned all the buildings there, sauing the church, and then returned backe
into Scotland with all their pillage and booties by Lauercost, an house of moonks, which
they likewise spoiled. So that the cruell &amp; bloudie desolation whereof Lucan speaketh in
his second booke of ciuill warres, may aptlie be inferred here, as fitlie describing the
mercilesse murther of all states and sexes without parcialitie vnder the hand of the enimie:

<p>Patrike earle of Dunbar came to the king of England, and submitted himselfe, with all
that he had into his hands; but the castell of Dunbar vpon saint Markes day, being
assieged of the Scots was rendered vnto them, by treason of some that were within it, of
whome, the countesse (wife to the same erle) was the ch&eacute;efest; for recouerie whereof
king Edward sent Iohn earle of Warren, Surrey and Sussex, &amp; William earle of Warwike
with a great power, the which laieng siege to that castell, a great host of Scotishmen came
vpon them to the rescue of them within, so that there was foughten a verie sore and terrible
battell. At length, the victorie abode with the Englishmen, and the Scotishmen were
put to flight, the Englishmen following them in chase eight mile of that countrie, almost
to the forrest of Selkirke: the slaughter was great, so that (as was est&eacute;emed) there died
of the Scotishmen that day, to the number of ten thousand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rockesborough y&eacute;elded.</div>

<p>The morrow after being saturdaie, which was the eight and twentith day of Aprill, at

same castell thr&eacute;e earles, Menteth, Cassels, and Ros; six barons, Iohn Comin the yoonger,
William Sanclere, Richard Siward the elder, Iohn Fitz Geffrey, Alexander de Morteigne,
Edmund Comin of Kilbird, with thirtie knights, two clearks, Iohn de Someruile, and
William de Sanclere, and thr&eacute;e and thirtie esquires, the which were sent vnto diuerse

went to the castell of Rockesborough, which incontinentlie was y&eacute;elded by the lord
Steward of Scotland, the liues and members of all such as were within it at the time of the
surrender.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rich. Southw.</i></div>

<p>Then went king Edward vnto Edinburgh, where he planted his siege about the castell,
and raised engines, which cast stones against and ouer the walles, sore beating and brusing
the buildings within. But as it chanced, the king writing letters, to aduertise his councell
at home of his proc&eacute;edings, and concerning other businesse, deliuered that packet vnto a
Welshman named Lewin, commanding him to go with the same to London in all hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
possible, for he knew him to be a verie sp&eacute;edie messenger and a trustie also (as he tooke
it.) But hauing the letter thus deliuered him, togither with monie to beare his charges, he
got him to a tauerne, where riotouslie c&#x014D;suming the monie (which he had so receiued) in
plaie, &amp; making good ch&eacute;ere, in the morning he caused one of his companions to take a
target, and beare it afore him in approching the castell, for that he meant (as he colourablie
pretended) not to depart, vntill he had wrought some displeasure to them within with his
crossebow, which he tooke with him for that purpose, so that comming vnto the castell
gates, he called to the wardens on the walles to cast downe to him a cord, that they might
plucke him vp to them therewith, for that he had somwhat to say to their capteine touching
the secrets of the king of England.</p>

<p>They fulfilling his desire, when he came in, and was brought afore the captein sitting
then at breakfast, he said vnto him: "Behold sir, here ye may peruse the king of Englands
secrets," and withall raught to him a box, wherein the packet of the kings letters were
inclosed, and "appoint me (saith he) to some corner of the wall, and trie whether I can
handle a crossebow or not, to defend it against your aduersaries." H&eacute;ere when others
would haue opened the box, and haue read the letters, the capteine would in no wise
consent thereto, but going into a turret, called to the Englishmen b&eacute;elow, and willed them
to signifie to the king, that one of his seruants being fled to him, sought to bewraie his
secrets, wherevnto he would by no means agr&eacute;e, and therefore meant to restore both the
traitor and the letters. Herevpon, the lord Iohn Spenser, comming to heare what the
matter might meane, the capteine caused Lewin to be let downe to him, togither with the
letters safe, and not touched by him at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Welshman hanged.</div>

<p>When the king vnderstood this, he much commended the honest respect of the capteine,
and whereas he had caused engins to be raised to annoie them within (as y&eacute;e haue heard)
he commanded the same to ceasse, and withall, vpon their capteins suit, he granted them
libertie to send vnto their king Iohn Balioll, to giue him to vnderstand in what sort they
stood. As touching the Welshman, he was drawne and hanged on a pair of high galowes,
prepared for him of purpose, as he had well deserued. A notable example of a traitorous
villaine, so to offer the secrets of his souereigne to be known to his enimies: and no lesse

<p>Now while the messengers were on their waie to Forfair, where the Scotish king then
laie, king Edward with a part of his armie went vnto Striueling, where he found the castell
gates set open, and the keies hanging on a naile, so that he entred there without any resistance,
for they that had this castle in gard, were fled out of it for feare before his comming.
The messengers that were sent from them within Edenburgh castell, comming to their king,
declared to him in what case they stood that were besieged. King Iohn, for that he was
not able to succor them by any manner of means at that present, sent them word, to take
the best waie they could for their owne safetie; with which answer the messengers returning,
the castell was immediatlie deliuered vnto the lord Iohn Spenser, that was left in
charge with the siege, at the kings departure towards Striueling, with the like conditions as
the castell of Rockesborough had y&eacute;elded a little before.</p>

<p>Thus was that strong castell of Edenburgh surrendred by force of siege, to the king of
Englands vse, on the 15 daie, after he had first laid his siege about it. A place of such
strength by the heigth of the ground whereon it stood, that it was thought impregnable, and
had not b&eacute;ene woone by force at any time, since the first building therof, before that
present, so farre as anie remembrance either by writing or otherwise could be had

Welshmen came vnto the king, who sent home the like number of English footmen, of
those that s&eacute;emed most wearie. Moreouer, at Striueling, there came to the king the earle
of Ulster, with a great number of Irishmen. Then passing ouer the riuer of Forth, the
king came vnto saint Iohns towne about Midsummer, and there tarried certeine daies.
Whilest these things were a dooing, Iohn king of Scotland, perceiuing that he was not of
power to resist king Edward, sent ambassadors vnto him to sue for peace: king Edward
was content to heare them, and therevpon appointed, that king Iohn should resort vnto
the castell of Brechin, there to commen with such of his councell as he would send thither
within fift&eacute;ene daies next ensuing, to treat of an agr&eacute;ement. King Edward sent thither
Anthonie bishop of Durham, with full commission to conclude all things in his name.

<div class="sidenote">The archbishop his words.</div>

<p>This yeare after the feast of the Epiphanie, Elizabeth the kings daughter was married
vnto king Iohn earle of Holland. Humfrey de Bohun earle of Hereford and Essex was
sent to conueie them into Holland, there to take possession of the earledome, as then
descended vnto the said Iohn, by the death of his father latelie before slaine by his owne
subiects, bicause he would haue disherited this Iohn, and made a bastard sonne which he
had to be his heire. &para; The day appointed for the parlement to be holden at London being
come, and the cleargie continuing in their deniall to grant any subsidie, the king excluded
them out of his protection, for the red&eacute;eming whereof, manie by themselues, and manie by
mediators, did afterwards giue vnto the king a fift part of all their goods. The archbishop
of Canturburie being found stiffe in the matter, the king seized all his lands, and commanded
all such debts as were found of his in the rolles of the excheker, to be leuied with all
sp&eacute;ed of his goods and cattell. Some write, that when the archbishop of Canturburie in
name of all the residue, had declared to them whom the king had appointed commissioners
to receiue the answer, that whereas they of the cleargie had two souereigne lords and
gouernours, the one in spirituall matters and the other in temporall, yet they ought rather
to obeie their spirituall gouernour than their temporall. Neuerthelesse, to satisfie the
kings pleasure, they would of their owne charges send to the pope, that by his licence and
permission, they might grant the king some aid, or else receiue some answer from him,
what to doo therein: "for (saith the archbishop) we bel&eacute;eue that the king feareth the
sentence of excommunication, and would be as glad to auoid it as we."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The declaration of the lord ch&eacute;efe iustice.</div>

<p>When the commissioners heard this answer, they required that they would appoint

furie proc&eacute;eded against them, in such rigorous manner as ye haue heard, in somuch that
the lord ch&eacute;efe iustice sitting vpon the bench, spake openlie these words; "You sirs that
be attornies of my lords the archbishops, bishops, abbats, priors, and all other the cleargie,
declare vnto your masters, and tell them, that from hencefoorth there shall no iustice be
doone vnto them in the kings court for any manner of thing, although neuer so heinous

<p>Henrie de Newarke the elect bishop of Yorke, with the bishops of Durnam, Elie and
Salisburie, with certeine other, fearing the kings indignation thus kindled against them,
ordeined to laie downe in the churches, a fift part as ye haue heard, of all their goods,
towards the defense of the realme, and maintenance of the kings warres in such time of
great necessitie, and so the king receiuing it, they were restored to the kings protection
againe. The fr&eacute;ends of the bishop of Lincolne found means, that the shiriffe of the shire
leuied and tooke the fift part of all his goods, and restored to him againe his lands and
possessions. Also, all the monasteries within his diocesse, and within the whole prouince
of Canturburie, were seized into the kings hands, and wardens appointed, which onelie
ministred necessarie finding vnto the moonks and other religious persons, and conuerted
the ouerplus vnto the kings vse. Wherevpon the abbats and priors were glad to follow the
court, and sued to red&eacute;eme, not their sins, but their goods, with giuing a fourth part
thereof. The cleargie suffered manie iniuries in that season, for religious men were
spoiled and robbed in the kings high waie, and could not haue any restitution nor remedie
against them that thus euill intreated them, till they had red&eacute;emed the kings protection.

<p>The archbishop of Canturburie lost all the goods that he had, for he would neither
agr&eacute;e to giue any thing, nor to laie any thing downe in the church, that the king might
receiue it. Wherevpon he was brought to such extreme miserie, that all his seruants went
from him, &amp; commandement was giuen foorth, that no man should receiue him, neither
within monasterie nor without, and so not hauing any one place of all his bishoprike where
to laie his head, he remained in the house of a poore person, onelie with one priest and
one clearke: yet he stiffelie stood in the matter, affirming certeinlie, that all those which
granted any thing, either to the king, or to any other temporall person without the popes
leaue, ran without doubt into the danger of the sentence pronounced in the canon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A parlement at Salisburie.</div>

<p>About the feast of S. Matthew in Februarie, the king called a parlement of his nobles
(not admitting thereto any of the cleargie) at Salisburie, and there required certeine of his
Nobles to passe ouer into Gascoine, but euerie of them s&eacute;emed to excuse himselfe, whereat
the king being mooued, threatened that they should either go, or he would giue their lands
to other that would go, with which words manie of them were gr&eacute;euouslie offended, in
so much that the earles of Hereford and Marshall, Humfrie Bohun, and Roger Bigod,
declared that they would be readie to go with the king if he went himselfe, or else not.
And when the earle Marshall was eftsoones required to go, he answered, "I will willinglie
go with the king, and march before him in the fore ward, as by right of inheritance I am
bound." "Yea (saith the king) and you shall go with other though I go not." "I am not
so bound (saith the earle) neither doo I purpose to take the iournie in hand with you."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The disloiall demeanor of the two erles.</div>

<p>The king then in a great chafe burst out &amp; sware, "By God sir earle, either thou shall go
or hang." "And I sweare (saith the earle) the same oth, that I will neither go nor hang:"
and so he departed from the king without leaue taking. Immediatlie herevpon those two
earles assembled manie noble men, and other of their fr&eacute;ends togither to the number of
thirtie banerets and aboue, so that in all they were found to be fift&eacute;ene hundred men of
armes appointed and readie for battell, and herewith they withdrew into their countries,
and kept such stir there, that they would not permit the kings officers to take neither
wools, leather, nor any thing against the owners will, but forbad them on paine of
loosing their heads to come within their roomes, and withall prepared themselues to resist
if n&eacute;ed were.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They had with them 600 men of armes, and 10000 footmen as <i>Abington</i> saith.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Battell betwixt the earle of Lincolne and the earle of Arthois, who had with him 1500 men of armes, as <i>Abingt&#x014D;</i> saith.</div>

<p>In this meane time the warre was prosecuted in Gascoine. &para; The thursdaie before the
Purification of our ladie, Henrie earle of Lincolne, and the lord Iohn saint Iohn departing
from Baion towards Bellegard, a place besieged as then by the earle of Arthois, to succour
them within the same with vittels, (whereof they stood in n&eacute;ed) as they approched to a
wood distant from the fortresse thr&eacute;e miles, they diuided themselues into two seuerall
battels, the lord Iohn saint Iohn leading the first, and the earle of Lincolne the second.
The lord saint Iohn therefore hauing passed the wood with his battell, and entring into the
plaine fields, was incountred by the earle of Arthois, who tarried there for him with a great
power, where immediatlie at the first ioining of the battels, the earle of Lincolne retired
backe: so that the lord Iohn saint Iohn and his companie ouerset with preasse of enimies
were vanquished: and the said lord saint Iohn with sir William de Mortimer, sir William
Burmengham and other to the number of eight knights, and diuerse esquires were taken,
the which were sent to Paris as prisoners.</p>

<p>Other write somewhat otherwise of this battell, as that vpon the first incounter the
Englishmen droue backe one regiment of the earle of Arthois his men of armes, whom he
diuided into foure parts; but when they once ioined with the second regiment, to the
which they were beaten backe, forward they came againe, and so charging the Englishmen,
with helpe of their third squadron, which was now come to them also, they easilie put the
Englishmen oppressed with multitude vnto flight, &amp; followed them in chase. After this
came the Englishmen which were in the rereward, and incountring with the fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
squadron or regiment of the Frenchmen, streightwaies brake the same. Herewith was
the night come vpon them, so that one could not know an other, a fr&eacute;end from an enimie,
and so both the Englishmen and Frenchmen were dispersed till the moone rose, and the
Frenchmen withdrew to their fortresses, and amongst them certeine Englishmen were
mingled, which being discouered were taken prisoners, as the lord Iohn saint Iohn, and
others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matth. West.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abington.</i></div>

<p>The slaughter was not great, for there were no footmen on either part, to spoile or kill
the men of armes that were throwne beside their horsses: for the English footmen remained
in the wood, or were withdrawne backe, as before ye haue heard, without attempting
any exploit worthie of praise. Ind&eacute;ed some laie the blame in the Gascoine footmen
for the losse of this battell, bicause that they withdrew backe, and left the English horssemen
in danger of the enimies which had compassed them about on euerie side. Thr&eacute;e
hundred of the men of armes came through to the towne of Bellegard, but bicause it was
night, so that they could not be discerned whether they were frends or foes, they within
the towne would not suffer them to enter: wherevpon they departed, and went to S. Seuere
foure leagues off. Yet further in the night, other of the Englishmen were receiued
into Bellegard, which came thither after the other, and so in the morning they of the garison
with their assistance issued foorth, and comming to the place where the battell had
b&eacute;ene, gathered the spoile of the field, and conueied into their towne such prouision of
vittels as they found there.</p>

<p>The earle of Lincolne with a great manie of other wandred a great part of the night and

Perforate, where he had lodged with his armie the night before, &amp; there found a great
number of his people right glad of his comming and happie escape out of danger. From
thence he returned vnto Baion with the earle of Richmond sir Iohn de Britaine and all his
companie that were left. And such was the hap of this iournie. In Lent following, those
that were dispersed here and there abroad, resorted to the earle of Lincolne, soiourning
at Baion, and in the summer season made a iournie towards Tholouse, spoiling and wasting
the countries of Tholouse and other there abouts, and remoued also the siege which
those of Tholouse had laid vnto a fortresse called S. Kiternes, in chasing them from the
same siege: and towards Michaelmasse they returned to Baion, and there laie all the
winter till after Christmasse, and then by reason of the truce concluded, as after appeareth,
betwixt the two kings of England &amp; France, they returned home into England.</p>

setting on of William Waleis: for the king of Englands iustice William Ormsbie, accordinglie
as he had in commission, confined and put to outlawrie a great sort of such Scotishmen,
as refused to doo fealtie and homage vnto the king of England, the which Scotishmen
being thus condemned as outlawes, elected the foresaid William Waleis for their capteine,
with whome William Douglas being once associated, the number of them increased
hugelie. The earle of Surrey and the treasurer being in England, those outlawes purposed
to haue taken the iustice at Scone: but he being warned though almost too late, escaped
himselfe with much adoo, leauing the most part of his people as a spoile to the enimies.
For William Waleis and his companie killed as manie Englishmen as fell into his hands,
and taking certeine religious men, he bound their hands behind them, and constreined
them to leape into the riuer, taking pleasure to behold how they plunged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The vnfaithfull dealing of the Scots.</div>

earle of Surrey should haue the leading of all such men of warre as might be leuied beyond
Trent, to represse the Scotish rebels, and also wrote vnto Iohn Comin earle of
Boughan, that remembring their faith and promise, they should returne into Scotland,

in the meane while remaind in the south parts of England. He would haue persuaded
such knights, gentlemen and other as held their lands of his father in Annandale, to haue

Scotish host, might behold where the same was lodged beyond a certeine lake. In that

archbishops, bishops, abbats, earles, lords, barons, and of all the communaltie, as well for
summoning them to serue by an vndue meane, as also for the vnreasonable taxes, subsidies,
impositions &amp; paiements which they dailie susteined, and namelie the impost augmented
vpon the custome of wooll s&eacute;emed to them verie gr&eacute;euous. For whereas for euerie
sacke of whole wooll there was fortie shillings paid, and for euerie sacke of broken wooll
one marke: it was well knowne, that the wooll of England was almost in value est&eacute;emed
to be woorth halfe the riches of the realme, and so the custome thereof paid, would ascend
to a fift part of all the substance of the land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Debate and fighting betwixt the mariners of the cinque ports and others.</div>

<p>The kings answer therevnto was, that he could not alter any thing, without the aduise
of his councell, of the which part were alreadie passed ouer into Flanders, and part were
at London; and therfore he required the said earles, that if they would not attend him
in that iournie into Flanders, they would yet in his absence doo nothing that might be
preiudiciall to the realme: for he trusted by Gods fauour to returne againe in safetie, and
set all things in good order. At length, about the 21 daie of August, the king tooke the
sea, and landed in Flanders n&eacute;ere to Sluice, about the 27 day of the same moneth. He
was no sooner on land, but that through old enuie and malice depending betw&eacute;ene the
mariners of the cinque ports, and them of Yermouth and other quarters, a quarell was
picked, so that they fell togither, and fought on the water in such earnest sort, notwithstanding
the kings commandement sent to the contrarie, that there were 25 ships burnt
and destroied of theirs of Yermouth, and other their partakers: also thr&eacute;e of their

<p>The king from Sluice first went to Bruges, and after to Gaunt, finding the countrie in
euill state, by reason that the good towns were not all of one mind: for diuers of them
misliked with the dooings of the earle, in that he had alied himselfe with the French kings
aduersaries. About the beginning of September was Lisle y&eacute;elded vnto the French king,
and after that they of Doway, Curtray, and Bruges, did likewise submit themselues to the
same king. Then was Charles earle of Valois sent to Bruges to fortifie that towne, and
to take the English nauie that laie at anchor in the hauen of Dam: but the Englishmen
hauing warning thereof, got foorth with their vessels into the sea, and so the earle of
Valois being disappointed of that preie, set in hand to fortifie Bruges and Dam. But the
earle of Austrich, &amp; Robert de Neuers son to earle Guy, being sent with a power of Englishmen,
Flemings, and other souldiors vnto Dam, fought with the Frenchmen, slue foure
hundreth of them, besides diuers that were taken, and recouered the towne. They might
also haue recouered Bruges, as was thought, if the Englishmen and Flemings had not
fallen at strife, &amp; fought togither about diuiding of the preie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The emperor Adulfe breaketh promise.</div>

<p>Finallie, after this, the French king came to Bruges, and when the king of England

had promised to come to their aid with a great armie; for the charges and wages wherof
he had receiued great summes of monie both of the king of England, and also of the earle
of Flanders: they concluded in the end (when they perceiued he would not come) to make
some agr&eacute;ement with the French king: and so first was a truce taken, from the middest
of October, vnto the calends of December, and after by mediation of Charles (surnamed
Claudius) king of Sicill, the same truce was prolonged as hereafter ye shall heare.</p>

<p>In this meane while, to wit, about the end of August, the earle of Surrey, when he saw
that the Scotishmen would not performe promise touching the deliuerie of the pledges, and
that William Waleis still mooued the people to rebellion, he assembled his armie, &amp; with
the same entring Scotland, came vnto Striueling. Then the lord steward of Scotland, and
also the earle of Lenox came vnto him, requiring him to staie till they might haue leasure
to s&eacute;e if they could bring the people of Scotland vnto the kings peace. But when they
could not doo it, they returned on the tenth day of September, promising to bring to the
aid of the earle of Surrey on the morrow after fortie horssemen, vpon the which day two
friers of the order of preachers were sent vnto William Waleis, and to the other Scotishmen
lieng beyond the hill aboue the monasterie of Scambeskin, to mooue them to the
kings peace. But their answer was, that they were not come to haue peace, but to trie

came vpon them yer the one halfe could get ouer, and so fiercelie assailed them,
that the Englishmen were beaten backe and slaine downe. For the Scots, after they saw
so manie of the Englishmen to haue passed the bridge, as they thought themselues able to
distresse, they made downe to the bridge foot, and with a number of their spearemen on
foot, closed it vp, that no more should come ouer to the aid of their fellowes, nor those
that were alreadie passed, should returne againe: yet one sir Marmaduke Thweng a right
valiant knight, which was one of the first among the men of armes that came ouer, after
that he and his companie had driuen downe one wing of their aduersaries, &amp; had followed

Surrey commanded to breake that end of the bridge, where they stood at defense to k&eacute;epe

(as some haue written) to the number of six thousand men, and amongst other was slaine
sir Hugh Cressingham, whose skin (as hath b&eacute;ene reported) the Scots stripped off his
dead carcasse, for the malice which they bare toward him. This discomfiture chanced on
the 11 day of September. The earle of Surrey, leauing in the castell of Striueling the
said sir Marmaduke Thweng, promised him to come to his aid at all times when n&eacute;ed
should be, within ten w&eacute;ekes space, and herewith taking his horsse, rode in such hast to
Berwike, that after his comming thither, his st&eacute;ed being set vp in the stable of the friers
minors, neuer after tasted meat, but died: after this, the said earle making no long
aboad in Berwike, rode vp to London vnto prince Edward, and left the towne of Berwike
as a preie to the Scotishmen: but those yet that had the castell in k&eacute;eping, defended
it manfullie against the Scots, the which assembled togither in campe vnder the leading of

finding the towne void of all defense, entred it, but they could not win the castell by any

<p>The Northumberland men conueied their wiues, their children, their cattell, &amp; other

but when the Scots lingered time, and entred not within the English borders for a season,
they brought their goods againe, in hope that the Scots would not come foorth of their
owne marches at that time. But the Scots hauing aduertisement thereof, about the feast
of S. Luke entred the English borders, and did much hurt within the countrie of Northumberland,
so that to auoid the danger, all the religious men fled out of the monasteries
situat betwixt Newcastell vpon Tine, and Carleill. The Scots spoiled, harried, and
burnt vp the countrie, till the feast of S. Martine, and in the octaues of the same feast
they drew togither, and went towards Carleill, which towne they summoned, as you shall

Inglewood, Cumberland, and Allerdale, till they came vnto Derwent and Cokermouth,

through vain feare of wrong information giuen by their spials, that the countrie was well
prouided of men of warre for defense, they brake off that iournie, and yet there were
not past a hundred men of armes, and thr&eacute;e thousand footmen in that countrie, which
were then also dispersed thorough irksomenesse of long staieng for the enimies. The
Scots therefore drew vnto Hexham, and there lodged, not without vexing the canons,
although they had granted letters of protection vnto the prior and couent of the same
house, to indure for one whole yeare: and likewise letters of safe conduct to passe and
repasse for one canon, one squire, and two seruants, when soeuer they should send to
them during that terme: which letters were giuen foorth vnder the name of the said earle
of Murrey, and William Waleis. From thence they went towards Newcastell, and burnt
the towne of Riton. Finallie, perceiuing they could not preuaile in attempting to win
the towne of Newcastell, they diuided their spoiles and returned home.</p>

<p>Whilest these things were in hand, prince Edward the kings eldest son, and other,
which had the rule of the realme in the kings absence, sought meanes to pacifie the earles
Marshall and Hereford: but they would not agr&eacute;e, but vpon such conditions as pleased
themselues to prescribe, which were, that the king should confirme the great charter, and
the charter of forrests, with certeine new articles to be included in the same great charter,
and that from thenceforth the king should not charge his subiects so fr&eacute;elie at his pleasure
as before time he had doone, without consent of the states of parlement, and that he
should pardon his displeasure and malice conceiued against them for denieng to go with
him into Flanders. Manie other articles they would that the king should grant, confirme,
pardon and establish. The which were all sent ouer into Flanders to the king, that he
might peruse them, and declare whether he would agr&eacute;e or disagr&eacute;e to the same. He as
one being driuen to the wall, thought good to y&eacute;eld vnto the malice and iniquitie of the
time, to reconcile the offended minds of the p&eacute;eres and barons of his realme, and granted
vnto all the said articles, confirming the same with his charter vnder his great seale. In
consideration wherof, the nobles of the realme and commons granted to the king the ninth
penie of all their goods: the archbishop of Canturburie, with the cleargie of his prouince,
the tenth penie; and the elect of Yorke and those of his prouince, granted the fift

to doo, that then they should resort and appeare at his parlement, to begin at Yorke the

earle of Warwike in his fathers roome: and of barons, the lord Henrie Percie, the lord
Iohn Wake, and the lord Iohn Segraue, with manie of the nobilitie, the which being assembled
togither, would that it should to all men be notified, in what manner the king
had confirmed the great charter, and the charter of forrests; wherevpon the same being
read with the articles therevnto added, and put in, the bishop of Carleill, adorned in
pontificalibus, did pronounce all them accurssed, that went about to violate and breake
the same. And bicause the Scotish lords appeared not, being summoned to be there, it
was decr&eacute;ed that the armie should come togither at Newcastell vpon Tine, in the octaues

chanced sedition betw&eacute;ene th' Englishmen &amp; the Gantners, insomuch that the Welshmen
had set fire on the towne, if the king had not staied the matter. But the Flemish writers
saie, the Englishmen set fire in foure parts of the towne ind&eacute;ed, that they might the more
fr&eacute;elie haue robbed in other parts thereof, whilest the townesmen had gone about to
quench the fire. But the townesmen bent on reuenge, assembled togither in great numbers,
and falling on the Englishmen slue thirtie of their horssemen and of their footmen
to the number of seuen hundred, or thereabouts. They had also slaine the king, if a
knight of Flanders had not made shift to saue him. &para; In d&eacute;ed (as should appeare by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>

y&eacute;elded themselues to the king at his first comming into the countrie.</p>

<p>And although the king caused certeine of those that had doone this outrage to be
hanged: yet the Flemings bare this &amp; other iniuries in their minds, &amp; meant to be reuenged

drew out of sundrie parts into the citie of Gant by small companies, to the number of

all the residue: but by the noise that was raised, the king had warning in what state the
matter stood, and therewith getting him to armour, came foorth of his lodging, and
streightwaies his people flocked about him. And furthermore, the footmen which were
lodged in the suburbes, hearing of this tumult, got them to armour, &amp; approching the
gates, found them shut: but with fire which they kindled with straw, wood, butter and
tallow, and other such things, they burnt vp the same gates and so got in, losing not past
six persons that were slaine at the first entring.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The earle of Flanders pacifieth his people.</div>

<p>Herewith the earle of Flanders came to the king, and besought him to staie his people

for the outragious attempt of his people, and bad him go to appease them, or he would
take paine with them himself to his owne suertie, though not greatlie to their ease. The
earle went, and preuailed so much, that at length he quieted them, and then was order
giuen for restitution of such things as had b&eacute;en taken from any man wrongfullie, according
to the order and direction prescribed by certeine discr&eacute;et persons appointed as
commissioners in that behalfe. The king perceiuing himselfe in some danger, and that
without the fauour of the Flemings he might hardlie escape out of their countrie, bare

had assembled an armie at Yorke, hauing first summoned the lords of Scotland to appeare

Waleis and other of the Scotishmen which laie there at siege, raised the same, and departed
from thence. The earle of Surrey comming to Rockesborough, and relieuing them
that kept it with such things as they wanted, passed foorth to Kelsow, and came afterwards
to the towne of Berwike, which the Scotishmen had left void. Here came letters
vnto them from king Edward, signifieng that he had taken truce with the French king,
and that he meant shortlie to returne into England, and therefore commanded them not to
make any further enterprise than the defending of the frontiers, and the recouerie of Berwike
till his comming ouer. Herevpon was a great part of the armie discharged, and

which were almost all Welshmen or Irishmen. There came also afterwards fiue hundred
men of armes well apparelled, furnished and mounted out of Gascoine, of the which
a certeine number were sent to Berwike by the king: where after the battell fought with
the Scots, they remained in garison. The earle of Hereford, and the earle Marshall were
present with their retinues amongst other in this armie here assembled at Rockesborough,
the which vpon suspicion conceiued of that they had heard, thought it not sufficient to
haue the kings letters patents touching the confirmation of the two charters, and other
the articles aboue mentioned, signed by him, whilest he was out of the realme, and therefore
required that he would now within his owne land confirme the same againe. Here
the bishop of Durham, Iohn earle of Surrie, William earle of Warwike, and Rafe erle of
Glocester, vndertooke for the king, that after he had subdued his enimies; and should be

The English fl&eacute;et that should haue come from Berwike, and kept alongst the coast to
haue furnished the armie with victuals, was staied and holden backe with contrarie winds,
so that the armie began to be in great necessitie of victuals. The Scotishmen were

downe with such violence, that he brake two of his ribbes, as the report went. Other
write, that his horsse trod on him in the night, as he and his people rested them, k&eacute;eping
their horsses still bridled, to be readie the sooner vpon occasion of any necessitie: but
howsoeuer he came by his hurt, he staied not to passe forward in his purposed iournie,
but mounting vpon an other horsse, went foorth with his armie till he came to a place
called Foukirke, where both the armies of England and Scotland met and fought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bishop of Durham led the second ward.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The lord Basset of Draitons words to the bishop of Durham.</div>

<p>The Scots were diuided in foure schiltrons, as they termed them, or as we may saie,
round battels, in forme of a circle, in the which stood their people that carried long
staues or speares, which they crossed iointlie togither one within another, betwixt which
schiltrons or round battels were certeine spaces left, the which were filled with their
archers and bowmen, and behind all these were their horssemen placed. They had
chosen a strong ground, somewhat sideling on the side of a hill. The earles Marshall,
Hereford, &amp; Lincolne, which led the fore ward of the Englishmen, at the first made
directlie towards the Scots, but they were staied, by reason they found a marish, or an
euill fauoured mosse betwixt their enimies and them, so that they were constreined to
fetch a compasse towards the west side of the field. The bishop of Durham ruling in
the second battell of the Englishmen, consisting of six and thirtie standards or banners,
knowing the let of that mosse or marish toward the east side, hasted foorth to be the first
that should giue the onset: but yet when they approched n&eacute;ere to the enimies, the bishop
commanded his people to staie till the third battell, which the king led, might approach.
But that valiant knight the lord Rafe Basset of Draiton said to him: "My lord bishop,
you may go and say masse, which better becommeth you, than to teach vs what we haue
to doo, for we will doo that which belongeth to the order and custome of warre."</p>

<div class="sidenote">These Scotish spearemen were of Gallowaie as <i>Euersden</i> saith.</div>

<p>Herewith they hasted foorth on that side to charge the first schiltron of the Scots, and
the earles with their battell on the otherside, and euen vpon the first brunt the Scotish
horssemen fled, a few onelie excepted, which staied to k&eacute;epe the footmen in order. And
amongst other was the brother of the lord steward of Scotland, who as he was about to
set in order the bowmen of Selkirke, by chance was vnhorssed, and slaine there amongst
the same bowmen, and manie a tall mans bodie with him. The Scotish archers thus
being slaine, the Englishmen assailed the spearemen; but k&eacute;eping themselues close
togither, and standing at defense with their speares like a thicke wood, they kept out the
English horssemen for a while, &amp; fought manfullie, though they were sore beaten with
shot of arrowes by the English archers on foot: &amp; so at length galled with shot; and
assailed by the horssemen on ech side, they begun to disorder and shrinke from one side to
another, and herewith the horssemen brake in amongst them, and so they were slaine and
beaten downe in maner all the whole number of them.</p>

at the least to the number of 15 thousand. The Scotish writers alledge that this battell
was lost by treason of the Comins and other, as in the Scotish historie ye may more
plainlie perceiue, with more matter touching the same battell: after this was the towne
of saint Andrews destroied, no man being within to make resistance. And from thence
the English armie came through Selkirke forrest vnto the castell of Aire, which they
found void: and after they came by the towne of Annan, and tooke the castell of Lochmaben,
and so returned into England by the west marches, and came to Carleill.</p>

<p>About the same time certeine Irish lords, and amongst other as ch&eacute;efe, one Thomas
Biset landed in the Ile of Araine, the inhabitants whereof y&eacute;elded themselues vnto the

besought him that it might please him to grant it vnto him and his heires for euer.

<div class="sidenote">His answer.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The addition put in the c&#x014D;clusion of the articles.</div>

<p>The king after this went to Durham, and from thence thought to haue returned streight
towards London, but hearing that the Scots meant to make some inuasion, he went to
Tinmouth, and remained there till towards Christmasse. Now when the king had laine
a certeine time at Tinmouth, he departed from thence, and drew southward, and comming
to Cotingham, a little from Beuerlie, held his Christmasse there, and after drew towards
London, where in the beginning of Lent, he held a parlement, at the which he was required
to k&eacute;epe promise for the confirmation of the two charters and articles concluded
with the earles of Hereford and Marshall. The king was nothing contented that this
matter should be so earnestlie called vpon, for loth he was to grant their full requests;
and againe to denie them, he stood in doubt how it might be taken: he therefore prolonged
time, &amp; would make no answer either to or fro. But when the lords vrged him
so sore to giue them answer, he got him out of the citie, not making them priuie of his
departure, and when they followed him, and s&eacute;emed not well contented that he should
so dissemble with them, he excused himselfe by blaming the aire of the citie to be against
his health, and therefore bare them in hand, that he onelie sought to refresh himselfe in
some better aire in the countrie more agr&eacute;eable to his nature: and as for answer to their
requests, he willed them to repaire againe to the citie, and they should haue answer by
his councell, so farre as should stand with reason to content them. They returned as he
willed them, and had the charters confirmed according to their requests, sauing that this
addition was put in the latter end of the same, Saluo iure coron&aelig; nostr&aelig;. With which
addition the lords were offended, and turned home to their houses in as great displ&eacute;easure
towards the king as before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The articles red in Paules churchyard.</div>

<p>The councell doubting some seditious stir to arise hereof amongst the people, deliuered

same might be read openlie before the people, which was doone in Paules churchyard in
presence of a great assemblie there, come togither and gathered for that purpose. The

<p>at the first before they heard the addition, gaue manie blessings to the king for those
grants: but when they heard with what words he concluded, they cursed as fast as before
they had blessed. Before this parlement was dissolued, the lords had warning to returne
againe shortlie after Easter, and then they had all things granted and performed as they
could wish or desire. The perambulations of forrestes were appointed vnto thr&eacute;e bishops,
thr&eacute;e earles, and thr&eacute;e barons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A bishop sent from the pope.</div>

<p>About the latter end of Iune there came ouer a bishop sent from pope Boniface as his
Nuncio, and diuerse other with him, to declare the order which the pope as arbitrator
indifferentlie chosen betwixt the kings of England and France, for the deciding of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
controuersies depending betwixt them, had giuen foorth &amp; decr&eacute;ed, which was in effect
as followeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The popes decr&eacute;e of peace betwixt the kings of England &amp; France.</div>

<p>1 First that king Edward being then a widdower should marrie the French kings sister
named Margaret, notwithstanding the degr&eacute;es of consanguinitie, for the which the pope
would dispense.</p>

<p>2 That the lord Edward the kings eldest sonne should at conuenient time take to wife
the ladie Isabell the French kings daughter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Nic. Triuet.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The popes request for the releasing to libertie of Iohn Balioll.</div>

<p>3 That the king of England should make satisfaction for the French ships which his
men had taken at the beginning of the war, and that sundrie townes in Gascoine should
be put into the popes hands, till it might be vnderstood vnto whome the right apperteined.
But those two last articles tooke small effect, the French king refusing to deliuer any of
those townes which he had gotten in possession. Moreouer, these messengers in the
popes behalfe required the king that he would set Iohn Balioll, sometime king of Scotland
at libertie, and restore those lands vnto his sonne Edward Balioll, which he ought to hold
within the realme of England, promising and vndertaking in the popes behalfe to preserue
and saue the realme harmelesse from all hurt and damage that might insue by the deliuerie
of the said Iohn Balioll.</p>

<p>King Edward vnderstanding that there was great danger in setting him at libertie, was
contented to deliuer him vnto the pope, but he refused to make restitution vnto Balioll of
the lands which he demanded. The popes ambassadours receiuing Iohn Balioll at king
Edwards hands, tooke him ouer with him into France, and there left him in the custodie
of the bishop of Cambrie, the popes deputie in that behalfe, where shortlie after he died.
After this, according to the couenants of agr&eacute;ement made betwixt the two kings of England
and France, the captiues vpon either part were deliuered. In the feast of the
natiuitie of our Ladie, the king married the ladie Margaret sister to the French king at
Canturburie with great solemnitie. About the feast of S. Martine in winter the king held
a parlement at Yorke, meaning to haue gone from thence into Scotland, to haue rescued
the castell of Striueling, which the Scotishmen had besieged, and had it surrendred vnto
them, yer the king could set forward to come to raise the siege. The same yeare died
Henrie Newarke archbishop of Yorke, and Thomas Corbridge a doctour in diuinitie
succ&eacute;eded him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A proclamation for monie.</div>

<p>In the eight and twentith yeare of his reigne, in the Christmasse season king Edward set
foorth a proclamation, forbidding and prohibiting all forren coins to be receiued and paid
as sterling monie within his dominion, commanding by the same proclamation, that two
p&eacute;eces of them should go for one sterling, vntill the feast of Easter. There were diuerse
monies in those daies currant within this realme, as pollards, crocards, staldings, eagles,
leonines, sl&eacute;epings, and all these were white monies, artificiallie made of siluer, copper,
and sulphur, so that it was an ill time for base monies, &amp; much chopping and changing
was vsed in buieng and selling of things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forren monies forbidden to go as currant.</div>

<p>At Easter following the king vtterlie forbad that any of those monies should be currant
at all, and held his exchange in sundrie places, and to be rid of them, men gaue fiue or
six of them for one sterling, not caring for them, bicause of their basenesse, and yet
within a yeare after that men had learned the skill by proofe how to trie mettall with melted
lead in the fire, they found that two p&eacute;eces of those base monies were in value worth one
sterling, and many became rich by the exchange, which had bought good store of them,
when they were so smallie est&eacute;emed: but the king caused inquirie to be made of them
that vsed such exchange without his licence, and put them to their fines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king goeth with an armie into Scotland.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas of Brotherton borne the first of Iune.</div>

<p>At a parlement holden at London in Lent this yeare, the king renewed the confirmation
of the charters, and made certeine new statutes concerning fines and goale deliueries,
verie profitable to the commonwealth. About the feast of saint Iohn Baptist, king
Edward went with an armie into Scotland, and there granted a truce to the Scots that
inhabited the mounteine countries to indure for eleuen moneths, that is to saie, till Whitsuntide
next insuing. As the king was vpon his iournie forewards in the north parts, his
late married wife qu&eacute;ene Margaret was deliuered of hir first sonne at Brotherton, a place
in Yorkeshire not farre from Pontfret; he was named Thomas, and tooke the surname of
Brotherton, of the place where he was borne.</p>

<p>Moreouer pope Boniface at the sute of the Scots wrote his letters vnto king Edward,
commanding him by the same and by the archbishop of Canturburie, whome he appointed
to deliuer the same letters by other letters to him directed, that he should not onelie release
and set at libertie all such Scots as he had in prison, but also giue ouer his warres which
he made against the realme of Scotland: and if he meant to make anie claime to the
same, then to send his procurators vnto the court of Rome, and there to shew what euidence
he could for his right thereto, where the mater (as he mainteined) was to be heard,
decided, and iudged; and not elsewhere. The archbishop, according to the popes commandement,
did the message, and presented the popes letters vnto the king, who deferred
the answer vnto the assemblie of the estates in parlement, and hereof the archbishop
aduertised the pope accordinglie, as in the letters to him directed he was commanded;
which he durst not but satisfie, bicause he was persuaded the popes authoritie to haue
b&eacute;ene so ample and peremptorie, that there was no resisting or gainesaieng of him,

<p>This yeare also on saint Remigius daie, which is the first of October, died Edmund earle
of Cornewall, the sonne of earle Richard, that was also king of Almaine; and bicause he
left no issue behind him to inherit that earledome, the same returned to the crowne. In
the 29 yeare of king Edwards reigne, on saint Oswalds day, or (as some haue written)
the friday after the feast of Peter Ad Vincula, his wife qu&eacute;ene Margaret was deliuered of
hir second sonne that had to name Edmund of Woodstoke, surnamed so of the place where
he was borne. &para; The king also this yeare after Christmasse held a parlement at Lincolne,
to the which the earls and barons of the realme came in armour, to the end (as it is
said) that they might procure of the king the more sp&eacute;edie execution of the charter of
forrests, which by him had hitherto b&eacute;ene delaied, but now that he perceiued their earnestnesse
and importunate suit, he condescended to their willes in all things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pope Boniface prohibiteth the king of England further to vex the Scots.</div>

<p>Pope Boniface being sollicited by the instant suit of the Scotishmen, and offended also
that the lands in England, which belonged vnto Edward Balioll sonne of Iohn Balioll,
were not to the same Edward restored, he eftsoones wrote to king Edward; forbidding him
from thence foorth any further to vex the Scots by wars, bicause that the kingdome of
Scotland was surrendred alreadie into his hands by the generall consent of the Scotishmen
themselues, and therefore was it in his power to bestow and take away the same to whom
or from whom soeuer it should please him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>N. Triuet.</i></div>

<p>&para; There were reasons alledged why the king of England s&eacute;emed to do wrong in challenging
as then the kingdome of Scotland: and amongst other, one was, that such homage
as had b&eacute;ene done of ancient time to the kings of England, by the kings of the Scots, was
onelie meant for Tindale, Penreth, and such other lands as the Scotish kings held within
England, and not for the realme of Scotland. And whereas the kings of Scotland had
aided the kings of England in their warres against the rebels of the realme of England, and
b&eacute;ene present at their coronation, the same was doone of speciall fauour, and not of dutie.
K. Edward hauing receiued the popes prescript, and well considered the whole contents
therof, sent in writing his answer at large, proouing by euident reasons that the right of
proprietie in the kingdome of Scotland, did most iustlie apperteine vnto him, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
allegations were not true, but forged, which had b&eacute;ene by surmised information presented
against him.</p>

<p>Beside the kings letters, which he wrote in his owne behalfe, there was an other letter
deuised and written by all the lords temporall of the land, assembled in parlement at Lincolne,
in which letter they answered in name of all the estates there gathered, vnto that
point wherein the pope pretended a right to be iudge for the title of the realme of Scotland,
protesting flatlie, that they would not consent that their king should doo any thing
that might tend to the disheriting of the right of the crowne of England, and plaine ouerthrow
of the state of the same realme, and also hurt of the liberties, customs, and
lawes of their fathers, sith it was neuer knowne, that the kings of this land had answered
or ought to answer for their rights in the same realme, afore any iudge ecclesiasticall or
secular.</p>

from the first beginning of the realme of England, the certeine and direct gouernment of
the realme of Scotland in all temporall causes from time to time belonged to the kings of
the same relme of England and relme of Scotland, aswell in the times both of the Britains
as also Englishmen, yea rather the same realme of Scotland of old time was in f&eacute;e to the
ancestours of our foresaid lords kings of England, yea and to himselfe.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the kings of Scots and the realme haue not b&eacute;en vnder any other than
the kings of England, and the kings of England haue answered or ought to answer for
their rights in the foresaid relme, or for anie his temporalities before anie iudge ecclesiasticall
or secular, by reason of fr&eacute;e preheminence of the state of his roiall dignitie and custome
kept without breach at all times. Wherefore, after treatie had, and diligent deliberation
of the contents in your foresaid letters, this was the common agr&eacute;ement &amp; consent
with one mind, and shall be without faile in time to come by Gods grace, that our foresaid
lord the king ought by no meanes to answer in iudgement in any case, or should bring his
foresaid rights into doubt, nor ought not to send any proctors or messengers to your
presence, speciallie s&eacute;eing that the premises tend manifestlie to the disheriting of the right
of the crowne of England, and the plaine ouerthrowe of the state of the said realme, and
also hurt of the liberties, customes and lawes of our fathers, for the k&eacute;eping &amp; defense of
which we are bound by the duetie of the oth made, and we will mainteine them with all
power, and will defend them (by Gods helpe) with all strength; and furthermore, will not
suffer our foresaid lord the king to doo or by anie means attempt the premisses being so
vnaccustomed, vnwont, and not hard of afore. Wherefore we reuerentlie and humblie
bes&eacute;ech your holinesse, that y&eacute;e would suffer the same our lord king of England, (who
among other princes of the world sheweth himselfe catholike and deuout to the Romish
church) quietlie to inioy his rights, liberties, customes, and lawes aforesaid; without all
impairing and trouble, and let them continue vntouched. In witnesse whereof, we haue
set our seales to these presents, as well for vs, as for the whole communaltie of the foresaid
relme of England. Dated at Lincolne the twelfth of Februarie, in the yeare of our Lord
1301, Et anno Edwardi primi 29.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A truce granted to the Scots.</div>

<p>The pope when he heard and deliberatelie pondered the kings answer, with this letter
directed to him from the English barons, waxed cold in the matter, and followed it no
further. The truce betwixt the king and the Scots being once expired, the king assembled
his armie, and went into Scotland, about the feast of saint Iohn Baptist, and tarieng
there all the summer and winter following, his souldiers lost manie of their great horsses for
lacke of forrage, which could not be gotten in the cold winter season. He kept his
Christmas at Lithquo, and at length at the request and sute of his brother in law the
French king, he granted eftsoones a truce to the Scotishmen, vntill the feast of All saints
next insuing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king returneth into England.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The pope exhorteth the K. of England to make war against Fr&#x0101;ce.</div>

<p>Then hauing ordered his business for that time in Scotland, he returned into England,
and about midlent called a parlement at London. Also this y&eacute;ere pope Boniface vpon
displeasure conceiued against the French king, sent vnto king Edward, exhorting him to
make warres against the same French king, and to persuade him the more easilie therevnto,
he promised him great aid: but the king of England hauing prooued the said pope,
not the surest man in friendship towards him, forbare to attempt anie forceable exploit
against the French king, trusting by some other meanes to recouer his right.</p>

sent downe to be published by the shirifs in euerie countie abroad in the realme: the
teste of the writ was from Westminster the sixt&eacute;enth of Iulie. &para; The citizens of Burdeaux
could not bare the yoke of the French bondage, and therefore this y&eacute;ere about
Christmasse expelled them out of their citie. &para; Shortlie after the French king doubting
least the king of England, by the setting on of the pope, should make warres against him
for wrongfull deteining of Gascoine, to purchase his fauor, restored to him all that which
he held in Gascoine, and so then they of Burdeaux also submitted themselues to the king

<div class="sidenote"><i>Polydor.</i></div>

<p>Now after that the truce with the Scots was expired, which tooke end at the feast of All
saints last past, the king sent the lord Iohn Segraue, a right valiant knight (but not so
circumspect in his gouernment as was necessarie) with a great armie into Scotland, to
haue the rule of the land as lord warden of the same: with him was ioined also Rafe
Confreie, treasurer of the armie. These two capteins comming to the borders, and hearing
that the Scotishmen alreadie were in armes, they entered into Scotland, and in order
of battell passed foorth to Edenburgh, and hearing nothing of their enimies which kept
them still in the mounteins, they deuided their armie into thr&eacute;e seuerall battels, two of the
which came behind the fore ward vnder the leading of the said Rafe Confreie, the third
(that is to say) the fore ward, the lord Segraue led himselfe, in such order that there was
the distance of foure miles betwixt their lodgings. This they did to be the more plentiouslie
serued of vittels.</p>

<p>But the Scots vnderstanding this order of their enimies, became the more hardie, and
therevpon hauing knowledge where the lord Segraue was lodged with his companie, a
good way off from the other two parts of the armie, they hasted forwards in the night
season, and came n&eacute;ere vnto the place where the same lord Segraue was incamped, a little
before daie, making themselues readie to assaile the Englishmen in their campe. But
the lord Segraue hauing knowledge of their comming, though he was counselled by some
of them that were about him, either to withdraw vnto the other battels, or else to send vnto
them to come to his aid, he would follow neither of both the waies; but like a capteine
more hardie than wise in this point, disposed his companies which he had there in order
to fight, and incouraging them to plaie the men, immediatlie vpon the rising of the sunne,
and that his enimies approched, he caused the trumpets to sound to the battell, and gaue
therewith the onset.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>N. Triuet.</i></div>

<div class="sidenote">The earle Marshall resigneth his lands vnto the king.</div>

<p>The fight was sore and doubtfull for a while, till the Englishmen ouercome with the
multitude of their enimies began to be slaine on ech side, so that few escaped by flight.
To the number of twentie worthie knights were taken, with their capteine the said lord
Segraue being sore wounded, but he was by chance rescued and deliuered out of the enimies
hands, by certeine horssemen, which vnder the leading of the lord Robert Neuell a
right valiant knight (vpon hearing the noise of them that fled) came on the spurs out of
the next campe to the succour of their fellowes. Rafe Confreie after this mishap (as Polydor
saithe) brought backe the residue of the armie into England, not thinking it necessarie
to attempt any further enterprise at that time against the enimies, ouermatching him
both in strength and number. This incounter chanced on the first sundaie in Lent.
&para; I remember the Scotish chronicles conteine much more of this enterprise greatlie to
their glorie, and more (haplie) than is true, as by conferring the place where they intreat
of it, with this that I haue here exemplified out of our writers it may well appeare. The
earle marshall hauing spent largelie whilest he stood in contention against the king, who
was now earnestlie called vpon to repaie such summes of monie as he had borowed of his
brother Iohn Bigod, who was verie rich by reason of such benifices and spirituall liuings
as he had in his hands, the earle bicause he had no children, to whom he might leaue his
lands, meant to haue left them vnto his said brother: but when he saw him so importunate
in calling for the debts which he owght him; he tooke such displeasure therewith,
that to obteine the kings fauour, and to disappoint his brother of the inheritance, he gaue
vnto the king all his possessions, vpon condition that the king adding thereto other lands
in value woorth a thousand markes by yeare, should restore them to him againe to inioy
during his life, the remainder after his deceasse to come vnto the king, and further, the
king should paie and discharge him of all his debts.</p>

streightwaies called a parlement, wherein by assent of the states a subsidie was granted,
towards the maintenance of his warres, and then the same being leuied he assembled his
people, and shortlie after about Whitsuntide entred into Scotland to reuenge the death of
his men. The Scots hearing of the kings comming, fled into the mounteins, mosses, and
marish grounds, not once shewing any countenance to fight any set battell with the English
host, so that the king in maner without resistance passed through the countrie euen vnto
Cathnes, which is the furthest part of all Scotland. Manie of the Scots perceiuing their
lacke of power to resist the English puissance, came to king Edward, and submitted themselues,
with condition that they should inioy their lands which he had giuen awaie to his
lords, they red&eacute;eming the same with conuenient fines, which was granted.</p>

that neither with feare, neither with offer of rewards could this Waleis be induced to follow
or behold the English K. ruling the realme of Scotland. King Edward returning
backe, came to the castell of Striueling (which the Scotishmen held against him) and besieged
it. The king himselfe laie at Dunfersing the most part of the winter: and whilest
he laie there, the qu&eacute;ene which had lien a long time at Tinmouth came to him, and when
the winter was once past, the king himselfe came to the siege, and caused certeine engins
of wood to be raised vp against the castell, which shot off stones of two or thr&eacute;e hundred
weight: but yet would not they within once talke of any surrender. And where the Englishmen
filled the ditches with wood and boughs of tr&eacute;es, they set the same on fire, and
burnt them to ashes: at length the ditches were filled with stones and earth, so that then
the Scots within perceiuing themselues in euident perill to loose the castell, on saint Margarets
daie they y&eacute;elded themselues simplie into the kings hands, as the English writers
affirme, though the Scotish writers record the contrarie.</p>

now the same had remained at Yorke aboue the space of six yeares, vpon this consideration,
that the king and his councell might be n&eacute;ere vnto Scotland to prouide for the defense

Lincolne, and there remained all the winter, holding a councell, in the which he eftsoones
confirmed the articles of Magna charta, touching the liberties, priuileges and immunities
of his subiects, the which to declare their thankfull minds towards him for the same,

<p>About the same time, Thomas Colebrugh or Corbridge archbishop of Yorke departed this

about the same time that valiant knight the lord W. Latimer. &para; Also Iohn Warren

son (named also Iohn) succ&eacute;eded him, obteining to wife the kings n&eacute;ece by his daughter
Elianor that was married to the earle of Bar, as before ye haue heard. Likewise Robert
Bruce earle of Carrike, the fift of that name died this yeare, who was father to that Robert
Bruce that was after K. of Scots. &para; Moreouer, about this season the king ordeined certeine
commissioners of iusticiaries, to make inquisitions through the realme, by the verdict
of substantiall iuries vpon all officers, as maiors, shiriffes, bailiffes, exchetors, and other
that had misused themselues in their offices, either by extortion, briberie, or otherwise, to
the gr&eacute;euance of the people, contrarie to that they rightlie might doo and iustifie by
vertue of their offices: by meanes of which inquisitions manie were accused and found
culpable, and therevpon put to gr&eacute;euous fines.</p>

<p>Also the iustices, which were assigned to take these inquisitions, extended the same
according to their commission against such as had made intrusions into other mens lands,
and for doubt to be impleaded for the same had made alienations ouer into the hands of
great men; also against such barretors as vsed to take monie to beat any man, and againe
would not sticke to take monie of him whom they had so beaten, to beat him that first
hired them to beat the other. The malice of such maner people was now restreined by
force of these inquisitions: for such as were found culpable, were worthilie punished,
some by death, and some by ransoms: diuerse also for feare to come to their answers fled
the realme: also forfeits against the crowne were streightlie looked vnto, found out, and
leuied; by reason whereof great summes of monie came to the kings coffers, which holpe
well towards the maintenance and charges of his warres. This kind of inquisition was
named commonlie Traile baston, which signifieth, Traile or draw the staffe. And forsomuch
as the proc&eacute;eding in this wise against such misdemenors as then were vsed, brought
so great a benefit to the realme in restreining such malefactors, which greatlie (as should
s&eacute;eme) disquieted the state of the commonwealth, I haue thought good to set downe the
substance of the same, as followeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hir punishment.</div>

<p>This yeare, Robert Bruce, contriuing waies how to make himselfe king of Scotland,
the nine &amp; twentith day of Ianuarie, slue the lord Iohn Comin at Dunfrice, whilest the
kings iustices were sitting in iudgement within the castell there, and vpon the day of the
Annunciation of our ladie, caused himselfe to be crowned king of Scotland at Scone,
where the countesse of Boughan, that was secretlie departed from hir husband the earle
of Boughan, and had taken with hir all his great horsses, was readie to set the crowne
vpon R. Bruces head, in absence of hir brother the earle of Fife, to whom (being in England)
soiourning at his manor of Whitwike in Leicestershire, that office of right apperteined.
This countesse being afterwards taken the same yeare by the Englishmen, where
other would haue had hir put to death, the king would not grant thervnto, but commanded
that she should be put in a cage made of wood, which was set vpon the walles of the
castell of Berwike, that all such as passed by might behold hir; too slender a punishment
for so great an offense. But the king counted it no honour to be seuere against that sex
whom nature tendereth, though malefactors, and therfore was content with a mild correction
tending rather to some shame than smart, to recompense hir offense, whereby she
procured against hir selfe no lesse reproch than she susteined, agr&eacute;eable to the old saieng,</p>

<p>There were present at his coronation foure bishops, fiue earles, and a great multitude
of people of the land. Immediatlie vpon the newes brought to the king of Bruces coronation,
he sent foorth a power of men, vnder the conduct of the earle of Penbroke, and
of the lord Henrie Percie, the lord Robert Clifford, and others, to resist the attempts of
the Scots, now readie to worke some misch&eacute;efe, through the incouragement of the new
king. Edward prince of Wales was made knight this yeare at London vpon Witsundaie,
&amp; a great number of other yoong bachelers with him (297 as Abington writeth) the
which were sent streightwaies with the said prince towards Scotland, to ioine with the
earle of Penbroke, to resist the attempts of the new king Robert le Bruce and his complices.
King Edward himselfe followed. The generall assemblie of the armie was
appointed at Carleill, fift&eacute;ene daies after the Natiuitie of saint Iohn Baptist, from thence

<p>In the meane time, Robert le Bruce went abroad in the countries of Scotland, receiued
the homages of manie Scotishmen, and got togither an armie of men, with the which he
approched n&eacute;ere to saint Iohns towne, into the which the earle of Penbroke was a little
before entred to defend it, with thr&eacute;e hundred men of armes, beside footmen. Then
R. Bruce sent to the earle to come out and giue battell, the earle sent vnto him word
againe, that he would not fight that daie being sundaie, but vpon the next morow he
would satisfie his request. Robert Bruce herevpon withdrew a mile backe from the
towne, determining to rest himselfe and his people that night. About euening tide came
the earle foorth of the towne with his people in order of battell, and assailing his enimies
vpon a sudden, slue diuerse yer they could get their armour on their backs. Robert
Bruce and others that had some space to arme themselues made some resistance for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>

<p>The earle following the chase, pursued them euen into Kentire, not resting till he
vnderstood that a great number of them were gotten into a castell, which he besieged, in
hope to haue found Robert Bruce within it, but he was fled further into the countrie.
Howbeit, his wife and his brother Nigell or Neall, with diuerse other were taken in this
castell, and sent in safetie vnto Berwike. Also shortlie after, the earle of Atholl was
taken, being fled out of the same castell. &para; But some write, that this earle was taken in
the battell last remembred, after long fight and great slaughter of Scots, to the number of
seuen thousand, and also that in the chase, the lord Simon de Friseill was taken, with the
bishops of saint Andrews and Glasco, the abbat of Scone, and the said earle of Atholl,
named sir Iohn Chambres. The bishops and abbat, king Edward sent vnto pope Innocent,
with report of their periurie: but others write, that the foresaid bishops and abbat

appointed to wait on hir. The earle of Vlster hir father, in the beginning of these last

he should thinke conuenient, to assure himselfe of him, that he would attempt nothing

<p>It should appeare by Robert Fabian, that the king was present himselfe at this battell:

the battell was fought at Dunchell vpon the riuer of Tay. But neither the Scotish chronicles

were sent before (as ye haue alreadie heard) with an armie, by whome as appeareth this

taken, and within it Christopher Seiton, that had married the sister of Robert le Bruce;

<p>About the feast of saint Michaell, the new Scotish king Robert le Bruce returned foorth
of the Iles (into the which he had fled) with manie Irishmen and Scots in his companie,
and remained a certeine time in Kentire, he sent certeine of his officers, to leuie and
gather vp the rents of the fermes due at the feast of saint Martine for such lands and possessions
as they held in that countrie, wherof the lord Percie being aduertised, hasted
thither; but the new king comming vpon him, slue certeine of his men, tooke his horsses
and plate, with other things, and droue him into a castell, within the which he besieged
him, till at length by a power sent from king Edward, Bruce was constreined to depart.
The king in this meane time was come to Lauercost n&eacute;ere to Carleill, and there remained
a long time. From thence he sent his iustices vnto Berwike, where they sate in iudgement
vpon Nigell Bruce, and the other prisoners taken with him, which were condemned to
die, and so they were hanged, drawen and quartered. The earle of Atholl was conueied
to London, and although he sued for pardon in respect of that he was of kin to the king,
yet was he hanged vpon a gibbet higher than all the residue, his bodie burned vnder the
same gibbet, and his head first cut off, was set vpon a pole ouer London bridge for example

<div class="sidenote">The summes of monie which the pope had of the archbish. of Yorke.</div>

<p>The elect archbishop of Yorke William Gr&eacute;enefield was confirmed this yeare by pope
Clement the fift, at the citie of Lions in France, where the same pope was crowned about
the same time, and held his court there, liuing ch&eacute;eflie by the monie which he got of
bishops that came to him for their confirmations: he had of the said archbishop of Yorke
within one yeare, nine thousand and 500 markes, besides the expenses which he was at
whilest he laie there, and so when this archbishop was returned into England, through
pouertie he was driuen to gather monie of the persons, pr&eacute;ests, and religious men within
his prouince at two sundrie times in one yeare, as first, in name of a courtesie and gratious
beneuolence, and the second time by waie of an aid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The great reuenues of Anthonie B. of Durham.</div>

<p>Moreouer, pope Clement ordeined Anthonie bishop of Durham, patriarch of Ierusalem,
dispensing with him, so as he held still the bishoprike of Durham, notwithstanding
his other promotion; and this was, bicause the bishop was rich, and the pope poore.
For this bishop might dispend in yearelie reuenues by purchases &amp; inheritances, besides
that belonged to his miter, aboue fiue thousand marks, and he gaue great rewards to the
pope, and to his cardinals, by means whereof he obteined in suit against the prior of
Durham, so that he had the charge and ouersight of the monasterie of Durham, both the
spirituall gouernement and temporall, through informing the pope, that the prior was
not able in discretion to rule the house. At his returning home, he caused a crosse of
siluer and gilt, adorned with an image of the crucifix, to be borne afore him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He is kept out of the abbeie at Durham.</div>

<div class="sidenote">He is summoned to app&eacute;ere before the K. and refuseth.</div>

<p>But where he appointed certeine persons as his deputies to enter into the priorie of
Durham, and to take charge thereof in place of the prior, the moonks shut the gates
against them, appealing to the pope, and pretending the kings protection, which they had
purchased. But those that thus came in the bishops name, accursed the moonks, &amp; so
departed. The king h&eacute;erewith was highlie offended, so that he caused them to answer
the matter afore the iustices of his bench, and for their presumption in pronouncing the
cursse, without making the king priuie to their dooings, they were put to their fines.
And whereas the bishop was summoned to appeare before the king in person at a certeine
daie, he made default, and departing out of the realme, got backe againe to the pope, contrarie
to the kings prohibition: wherevpon the liberties of the s&eacute;e of Durham were seized
into the kings hands, and the king placed his iustices and chancellor there, and in the yeare
next insuing, he exacted of the tenants of the archbishoprike, the thirt&eacute;enth penie of their

<p>The conclusion of this matter was this, that the prior was cited by the pope, to appeare
at his consistorie, whither he went, hauing the kings letters in his fauour directed to the
pope; wherevpon, when the pope had examined the matter, and heard the prior speake
in his owne person, he perceiued him to be otherwise than he was informed (a sober and
discr&eacute;et man) and therefore restored him againe to the gouernment of his house; but he
remained in the popes court, till after the kings death, and finallie died there himselfe in
the yeare 1307. But now to returne to other dooings of king Edward. We find, that
whilest he lay still at Lauercost, he gaue to the earle of Warwike Bernards castell, the
which he had by escheat, through forfeiture thereof made by Iohn Balioll late king of Scotland.
He also tooke and seized into his hands Penreth with the appurtenances.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Abington.</i></div>

<p>In the octaues of S. Hilarie, the king held a parlement at Carleill, in the which, by the
p&eacute;eres of the realme, great complaint was made of the oppressions doone to churches, abbeies,
and monasteries, by reason of paiments latelie raised and taxed by one maister
William or Guilelmo Testa the popes chapleine. Commandement therefore was giuen
to the same chapleine, that from thencefoorth he should not leauie anie such paiments;
and for further remedie, messengers were made foorth vnto the pope, to declare vnto him
the inconuenience thereof. This Testa was sent from pope Clement into England with
bulles, in the contents whereof it appeared, that the pope had reserued to himselfe the
first fruits of one yeares reuenues of euerie benefice that fell void by anie manner of
meanes within the realme of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, and likewise of all
abbeies, priories, and monasteries; so that it may well be said of him &amp; his retinue, according
to the processe of all their actions, as it was said of old,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Curia Romana non qu&aelig;rit ouem sine lana.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the king and lords of the land thought it against reason, that the pope should take
and receiue the profits of those abbeies and monasteries, which had b&eacute;ene founded by their
predecessors for the seruice of God, and the maintenance of almesd&eacute;eds, and good hospitalitie
to be kept: and so the pope changed his purpose, touching abbeies, but granting to
the K. the tenth of the English churches for two y&eacute;ers, he obteined the first fruits of
the same churches for himselfe, as before he required. In the same parlement were statutes
made concerning religious men, which had their head and ch&eacute;efest houses in forren

<p>There came also at the same time, a cardinall from the pope, named Petrus Hispanus
to procure the consummation of the mariage, betwixt the prince of Wales, and the French
kings daughter; for the same was delaied, by reason that all couenants were not kept on
the French kings behalfe, touching the deliuerie of the townes in Gascoine. For whereas
in times past, the French king had giuen one of those townes that were taken from the
Englishmen, named Mauleon, vnto a French knight; he kept the same still, and would
not deliuer it now at the French kings commandement, where-through (as was said) the
marriage had b&eacute;ene hitherto deferred. The same cardinall by vertue of his bull, would
haue had of euerie cathedrall church, colledge, abbeie, and priorie, twelue marks of sterling
monie; and of euerie person of parish churches eight pence of euerie marke of his reuenues.
But the English cleargie appealed from this exaction, so that by the king and his
councell it was ordeined, that he should haue no more than in times past cardinall Othobon
did receiue, that is to saie, the halfe of his demand. Moreouer, this cardinall being at
Carleill, and hauing made a sermon in praise of peace, vpon the conclusion of marriage
betwixt the prince of Wales and the French kings daughter, in the end he reuested himselfe
and the other bishops which were present, and then with candels light, and causing
the bels to be roong, they accursed in terrible wise Robert Bruce the vsurper of the crowne

Thomas that was a knight, and Alexander that was a pr&eacute;est, with part of his armie
into an other quarter of the countrie, to allure the people vnto his obedience, partlie
with gentlenesse, and partlie with menaces. But the Englishmen came vpon them in the

and therevpon hanged, drawen and quartered. &para; Some write, that Duncan Magdoill,
a man of great power in Galloway, tooke these two brethren prisoners, togither with Reginald

with diuerse other, but also slue Malcolme Makaile a lord of Kentire, and two Irish lords,

Penbroke and put him to flight, and slue some of his men though not manie. Within a few
daies after, he chased also the earle of Glocester, into the castell of Aire, and besieged
him within the same, till an armie was sent from king Edward to the rescue: for then the
said Robert was constreined to fl&eacute;e, and the Englishmen followed, till he got into the
woods and marishes, where they might come n&eacute;ere him without manifest danger, to cast
themselues awaie. &para; The king of England, minding to make a full conquest of the Scots,
and not to leaue off vntill he had wholie subdued them, sent his commissions into England,
commanding all those that owght him seruice, to be redie at Careleill within thr&eacute;e w&eacute;ekes

and brought into Deuonshire, to worke there in those siluer mines, as appeareth
by the allowance demanded by the said master William de Wimondham in his roll of accounts,
deliuered that yeare into the excheker: and there was brought from thence to
London the same yeare of siluer fined and cast in wedges 700 foure pounds, thr&eacute;e shillings,
one penie weight. In the 25 yeare of his reigne, there were thr&eacute;e hundred and
fourtie eight miners brought againe out of the Peake into Deuonshire, and out of Wales
there were brought also 25 miners, which all were occupied about those siluer mines,
beside others of the selfe countrie of Deuonshire, and other places. Also Wil. de Aulton
clearke, k&eacute;eper of the kings mines in Deuonshire and Cornewall, was accomptant of the
issues and profits of the kings mines there, from the fourth of March, Anno 26 of his
reigne, till the eight&eacute;enth of Aprill, Anno 27, and y&eacute;elded vp his account, both of the
siluer and lead.</p>

<p>But now to conclude with this noble prince king Edward the first, he was sure not
onelie valiant but also politike, labouring to bring this diuided Ile, into one entier monarchie,
which he went verie n&eacute;ere to haue atchiued, for whereas he was fullie bent to
make a conquest of Scotland, in like case as he had alreadie doone of Wales, if he had
liued any longer time to haue dispatched Robert le Bruce, that onelie stood in his waie,
it was verie likelie that he should haue found none other to haue raised banner against
him about the quarrell or title to the claime of that realme. For as he was a right warlike
prince of him selfe, so was he furnished with capteins and souldiers answerable to his
desire, who being able to lead and command them of himselfe, had them at length obedient
inough to serue him, although (as partlie y&eacute;e haue heard) some of the p&eacute;eres shewed themselues
at times disobedient and stubborne, whom yet in the end he tamed well inough, as
the earles of Hereford and Northfolke, the which in the thirtith yeare of his reigne
resigned their castels and manours into his hands, as by the records of the tower it further
may appeare.</p>
